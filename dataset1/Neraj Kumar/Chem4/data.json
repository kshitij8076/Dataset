Assume that the walls, ceiling, floor, and furniture are perfectly insulated and do not absorb any heat. Also assume that all the doors and windows are tightly closed to prevent any exchange of air from surrounding. How long (in sec) will the physical chemistry examination last if the professor (Mr Neeraj Kumar) has foolishly agreed to dismiss the class when the air temperature in the room reaches body temperature, 310 K? For air, C_p,m = 7R/2. (R = 0.0821 L-atm/K-mol = 8.3 J/K-mol)",
