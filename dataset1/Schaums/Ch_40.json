    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "Experiment shows that, in this situation, cancellation occurs when d is near zero. This is due to the fact that light often undergoes a phase shift upon reflection. The process is generally rather complicated, but for incident angles less than about 30°, it’s fairly straightforward. Then there will be a net phase difference of 180° introduced between the internally and externally reflected beams. Thus when the film is very thin compared to λ and d ≈ 0, there will be an apparent path difference for the two beams of λ/2 and cancellation will occur. Destructive interference occurs for d = 0, as we have just seen. When d = λ/2 cancellation occurs. The same thing happens when d = λ + λ/2. Therefore cancellation occurs at d = 0, 300 nm, and 600 nm. Reinforcement occurs when d = λ/4 because then beam 2 acts though it had traveled an additional λ/2 + (2)(λ) = λ. Reinforcement again occurs when d is increased by λ/2 and by λ."

    "solution": "Darkness is observed when the light beams from the two legs are 180° out of phase. As the length of one leg is increased by λ/2, the path length (down and back) increases by λ and the field of view changes from dark to bright. When 150 fringes pass, the leg is lengthened by an amount (150)(λ/2) = (150)(240 nm) = 36,000 nm = 0.0360 cm."

The two reflected beams traverse different paths. The difference in path length causes interference, and this interference is constructive or destructive depending on the thickness of the spacer. For the five dark fringes, d = (m + ½)λ. For m = 1, d = (1)(589.0 nm) = 1178 nm."

    "solution": "(a) The gap thickness is zero at the central dark spot. It increases by λ/2 as we move from a position of darkness to the next position of darkness. Therefore, at the third dark ring, gap thickness = 3(λ/2) = 750 nm. (b) The gap thickness at the first bright ring must be large enough to increase the path length by λ/2. Since the ray traverses the gap twice, the thickness there is λ/4. As we go from one bright ring to the next, the gap thickness increases by λ/2. Therefore, at the second bright ring, gap thickness = (0.750)(500 nm) = 375 nm."
