    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "There are 238 nucleons involved. Each nucleon will release about 8.6 - 7.6 = 1.0 MeV of energy when the nucleus undergoes fission. The total energy liberated is therefore about 238 MeV or 2.4 x 10^2 MeV."

(b) What mass of uranium does it consume each day?",
    "year": null,
    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "(a) Each fission yields 200 MeV = (200 x 10^6)(1.6 x 10^-19) J of energy. Only 20 percent of this is utilized efficiently, and so Usable energy per fission = (200 x 10^6)(1.6 x 10^-19)(0.20) = 6.4 x 10^-12 J. Because the reactor's usable output is 700 x 10^6 J/s, the number of fissions required per second is Fissions/s = 700 x 10^6 / 6.4 x 10^-12 = 1.1 x 10^18 s^-1.

We want n large enough so that (0.6)^n(8 x 10^5 eV) = 0.040 eV. Taking the logarithms of both sides of this equation gives n log 0.6 + log(8 x 10^5) = log 0.04.
