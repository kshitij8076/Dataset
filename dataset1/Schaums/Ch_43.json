    "year": null,
    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "Since Eₙ = -13.6/n² eV, we have E₅ = -0.54 eV and E₂ = -3.40 eV. The energy difference between these states is 3.40 - 0.54 = 2.86 eV. Because 1240 nm corresponds to 1.00 eV in an inverse proportion, we have, for the wavelength of the emitted photon, λ = (1.00 eV / 2.86 eV)(1240 nm) = 434 nm."

To find the corresponding wavelengths, we use ΔE = hf = hc / λ. For example, for the n = 2 to n = 1 transition, λ = (6.63 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s)(2.998 x 10⁸ m/s) / (10.2 eV)(1.602 x 10⁻¹⁹ J/eV) = 1.22 nm.

From the diagram, the two smallest-energy transitions to the n = 2 states are: n = 3 → n = 2 : ΔE₃₂ = 13.6 - 6.04 = 7.6 eV, n = 4 → n = 2 : ΔE₄₂ = 13.6 - 3.4 = 10.2 eV.

    "solution": "The photons in the beam must ionize the atom so as to produce free electrons. (This is called the atomic photoelectric effect.)
