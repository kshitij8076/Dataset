    "solution": "Because the speed of sound increases by 0.61 m/s for each 1.0°C, we have\nv = 331 m/s + (0.61)(14) m/s = 340 m/s.\nUsing s = vt, we find that the time taken is\n t = s / v = 6000 m / 340 m/s = 17.6 s."

    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "The speed of sound is v ≈ 333 m/s ≈ 3 km/s, so the distance to the flash is\ns = vt ≈ l / 3.\nwhere t, the travel time of the sound, is in seconds and s is in kilometers. The light from the flash travels so fast, 3 × 10⁸ m/s, that it reaches the observer almost instantaneously. Hence t is essentially equal to the time between seeing the flash and hearing the thunder.
