    "year": null,
    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "The image must be on the same side of the lens as the distant object (hence the image is virtual and s₀ = -80 cm), and nearer to the lens than the object (hence diverging or negative lenses are indicated). As the object is at a great distance, s₀ is very large and 1/s₀ is practically zero. Then, f = -80 cm (diverging). Power in diopters = 1/f in meters = 1/(-0.80 m) = -1.3 diopters."
