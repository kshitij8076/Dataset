    "year": null,
    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "The same number of wave peaks leave the air each second as enter into the water. Hence the frequency is the same in the two materials. But because wavelength = (speed)/(frequency), the wavelength in water is three-fourths that in air. The refractive index of water is 1.33."
