    "year": null,
    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "We know that v = λf = (0.600 m)(120 s⁻¹) = 72.0 m/s. Further, since v = √(tension / mass per unit length), the tension in the cord balances the weight of the mass hung at its end. Therefore, Fr = mg or m = 1.50 N / 9.81 m/s² = 0.153 kg."

    "year": null,
    "question_type": "Problem",
    "solution": "(a) We shall use v = √(tension / mass per unit length). The midpoint of the cable supports half its weight, so the tension there is, Fₓ = ½(5.0 kg)(9.81 m/s²) = 24.5 N. The mass per unit length = 0.25 kg/m, so v = √(24.5 N / 0.25 kg/m) = 9.9 m/s.\n(b) Because wave crests do not pile up along a string or cable, the frequency, 7.0 Hz, is the same at all points. To find the wavelength at the midpoint, we use the speed we found for that point, 9.9 m/s, yielding λ = v / f = 9.9 m/s / 7.0 Hz = 1.4 m."

    "solution": "In the fundamental, L = λ/2. Since λ = v/f, we have f₁ = v / 2L. Originally, the string of length L₁ resonated to a frequency of 196 Hz, and so\n196 Hz = v / 2L₁\nWe want it to resonate to 440 Hz, so we have\n440 Hz = v / 2L₂.\nTo eliminate v from these two simultaneous equations and find L₂, we get\nL₂ / L₁ = 196 Hz / 440 Hz = 0.445.\nTherefore, the finger must shorten the string to 0.445 of its original length."

Because the distance from node to antinode is always ½λ, we see that L = 2(½λ). Since L = 0.60 m, we find λ = 1.20 m.\nThen, from the basic relation (p. 214) v = λf, we have v = (1.20 m)(3.0 kHz) = 3.6 km/s."

In our case, the top resonance form applies, since the segments are longest for it and its frequency is therefore lowest. For that form, L = λ/4, so λ = 4L = 4(0.90 m) = 3.6 m.\nUsing λ = vT = v/f gives v = (3.6 m)(95 s⁻¹) = 340 km/s."

    "solution": "The clamped point remains stationary, and so a node exists there. Since the ends of the rod are free, antinodes exist there. The lowest-frequency resonance occurs when the rod is vibrating in its longest possible segments. In Fig. 22-6 we show the mode of vibration that corresponds to this condition. Since a segment is the length from one node to the next, then the length from A to N in the figure is one-half segment. Therefore, the rod is two segments long. This resonance form satisfies our restrictions about positions of nodes and antinodes, as well as the condition that the bar vibrate in the longest segments possible. Since one segment is λ/2 long, L = 2(λ/2), or λ = L = 200 cm.\nThen, from λ = vT = v/f, v = λf = (2.00 m)(3 × 10³ s⁻¹) = 6 km/s."
