    "Questions": "Employing Thomson's model, calculate the radius of a hydrogen atom and the wavelength of emitted light if the ionization energy of the atom is known to be equal to E = 13.6 eV.",
    "Answers": "In this chapter the formulas in the book are given in the CGS units. Since most students are familar only with MKS units, we shall do the problems in MKS units. However, where needed, we shall also write the formulas in the Gaussian units.\n6.1 The Thomson model consists of a uniformly charged nucleus in which the electrons are at rest at certain equilibrium points (the plum in the pudding model). For the hydrogen nucleus the charge on the nucleus is +e while the charge on the electron is -e. The electron by symmetry must be at the centre of the nuclear charge where the potential (from problem (3.38a)) is\nφ₀ = (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * (3 e / 2 R)\nwhere R is the radius of the nuclear charge distribution. The potential energy of the electron is - e φ₀ and since the electron is at rest, this is also the total energy. To ionize such an electron will require an energy of E = e φ₀\nFrom this we find\nR = (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * (3 e² / 2 E)\nIn Gaussian system the factor 1 / (4 π ε₀) is missing.\nPutting the values we get\nR = 0.159 nm.\nLight is emitted when the electron vibrates. If we displace the electron slightly inside the nucleus by giving it a push r in some radial direction and an energy δ E of oscillation then since the potential at a distance r in the nucleus is\nφ(r) = (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * (e / R) * (3/2 - r² / (2 R²))\nthe total energy of the nucleus becomes\n1/2 m ṙ² - (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * e² / R * (3/2 - r² / (2 R²)) = - e φ₀ + δ E\nor\nδE = 1/2 m ṙ² + (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * (e² / (2 R³)) * r²\nThis is the energy of a harmonic oscillator whose frequency is :\nω² = (1 / (4 π ε₀)) * (e² / (m R³))\nThe vibrating electron emits radiation of frequency ω whose wavelength is\nλ = 2 π c / ω = 2 π c * sqrt(m R³ (4 π ε₀) / e²)\nIn Gaussian units the factor ( 4 π ε₀ )¹ᐟ² is missing.\nPutting the values we get λ = 0.237 μ m."

    "Questions": "To what minimum distance will an alpha particle with kinetic energy T = 0.40 MeV approach in the case of a head-on collision to\n(a) a stationary Pb nucleus;\n(b) a stationary free Li⁶ nucleus?",
    "Answers": "(a) In the Pb case we shall ignore the recoil of the nucleus both because Pb is quite heavy (A_Pb = 208 = 52 x A_He) as well as because Pb in not free. Then for a head on collision, at the distance of closest approach, the K.E. of the α - particle must become zero (because α - particle will turn back at this point). Then\n( 2 z e² / (4 π ε₀) r_min ) = T\n(No ( 4 π ε₀ ) in Gaussian units.). Thus putting the values\nr_min = 0.591 pm.\n(b) Here we have to take account of the fact that part of the energy is spent in the recoil of Li nucleus. Suppose x₁ = coordinate of the α - particle from some arbitrary point on the line joining it to the Li nucleus, x₂ = coordinate of the Li nucleus with respect to the same point. Then we have the energy momentum equations\n1/2 m₁ ẋ₁² + 1/2 m₂ ẋ₂² + ( 2 x 3 e² / (4 π ε₀) |x₁ - x₂| ) = T\nm₁ ẋ₁ + m₂ ẋ₂ = sqrt(2 m₁ T)\nHere m₁ = mass of He⁺⁺ nucleus, m₂ = mass of Li nucleus. Eliminating ẋ₂\nT = 1/2 m₁ ẋ₁² + 1 / (2 m₂) * (sqrt(2 m₁ T) - m₁ ẋ₁)² + ( 6 e² / (4 π ε₀) (x₁ - x₂) )\nWe complete the square on the right hand side and rewrite the above equation as\n(m₂ / (m₁ + m₂)) T = 1 / (2 m₂) [ sqrt(m₁ (m₁ + m₂) ẋ₁) - (m₁ / sqrt(m₁ + m₂)) * sqrt(2 m₁ T) ]² + ( 6 e² / (4 π ε₀) |x₁ - x₂| )\nFor the least distance of approach, the second term on the right must be greatest which implies that the first term must vanish.\nThus\n|x₁ - x₂|_min = ( 6 e² / (4 π ε₀) T ) * ( 1 + m₁ / m₂ )\nUsing m₁/m₂ = 4/7 and other values we get\n|x₁ - x₂|_min = 0.34 pm .\n(In Gaussian units the factor 4 π ε₀ is absent)."

    "Answers": "(a) When the partially filled shell contains three p electrons, the total spin S must equal 1/2 or 3/2. The state S=3/2 has maximum spin and is totally symmetric under exchange of spin lables. By Pauli's exclusion principle this implies that the angular part of the wavefunction must be totally anti symmetric. Since the angular part of the wave function a p electron is vector r⃗ᵢ the total wavefunction of three p electrons is the totally antisymmetric combination of r⃗₁, r⃗₂, and r⃗₃. The only such combination is\nr⃗₁·(r⃗₂ x r⃗₃) = |x₁ y₁ z₁; x₂ y₂ z₂; x₃ y₃ z₃|\nThis combination is a scalar and hence has L=0. The spectral term of the ground state is then\n⁴S₃/₂ since J = 3/2.\n(b) We can think of four p electrons as consisting of a full p shell with two p holes. The state of maximum spin is then S=1. By Pauli's principle the orbital angular momentum part must be antisymmetric and can only have the form\nr⃗₁ x r⃗₂\nwhere r⃗₁, r⃗₂ are the coordinates of holes. The result is harder to see if we do not use the concept of holes. Four p electrons can have S=0, 1, 2 but the S=2 state is totally symmetric. The corresponding angular wavefunction must be totally antisymmetric. But this is impossible if there is no quantity which is antisymmetric in four vectors. Thus the maximum allowed S is S=1. We can construct such a state by coupling the spins of electrons 1 & 2 to S=1 and of electrons 3 & 4 to S=1 and then coupling the resultant spin states to S=1. Such a state is symmetric under the exchange of spins of 1 & 2nd 3 and 4 but antisymmetric under the simultaneous exchange of (1, 2) & (3, 4). The conjugate angular wavefunction must be antisymmetric under the exchange of (1, 2) and under the exchange of (3, 4) by Pauli principle. It must also be antisymmetric under the simultaneous exchange of (1, 2) and (3, 4). (This is because two exchanges of electrons are involved.) The required angular wavefunction then has the form\n(r⃗₁ x r⃗₂) x (r⃗₃ x r⃗₄)\nand is a vector, L=1. Thus, using also the fact that the shell is more than half full, we find the spectral term\n³P₂ (J=L+S)."

    "Answers": "(a) The maximum spin angular momentum of three electrons can be S=3/2. This state is totally symmetric and hence the conjugate angular wavefunction must be antisymmetric. By Pauli's exclusion principle the totally antisymmetric state must have different magnetic quantum numbers. It is easy to see that for d electrons the maximum value of the magnetic quantum number for orbital angular momentum |M_L|ₘₐₓ = 3 (from 2+1+0). Higher values violate Pauli's principle. Thus the state of highest orbital angular momentum consistent with Pauli's principle is L=3.\nThe state of the atom is then ⁴Fⱼ where J=L-S by Hund's rule.

Thus the transitions between ¹P₁ & ¹S₀ will result in 3 lines i.e. a normal Zeeman triplet.\n(b) The term ²D₅/₂ will split ot in 6 terms in accordance with the formula\nΔE = -gμ_B M_z\nM_z = ±5/2, ±3/2, ±1/2 and\ng = 1+(5x7/4+1x3/4-2x3)/(2x5x7) = 6/5\nTher term ²P₃/₂ will also split into 4 lines in accordance with the above formula with\nM_z = ±3/2, ±1/2 and g = 1+(3x5/4+1x3/4-1x2)/(2x3x5) = 4/3\nIt is seen that the Z eeman splitting is auomalous as g factors are different.\n(c) ³D₁ → ³P₀\nThe term ³D₁ splits into 3 levels (g=5/2)\nThe term ³P₀ does not split. Thus the Zeeman spectrum is normal.\n(d) For the ⁵I₅ term\ng = 1+(5x6+2x3-6x7)/(2x5x6) = 1 - 1/10 = 9/10\nFor the ⁵H₄ term\ng = 1+(4x5+2x3-5x6)/(2x4x5) = 1+(26-30)/40 = 9/10\nWe see that the splitting in the two levels given by ΔE = -gμ_B M_z is the same though the number of levels is different (11 and 9).

    "Answers": "Energy of pions is (1+η)m₀c² so\n(1+η)m₀c² = m₀c²/√1-β²\nHence\n1/√1-β² = 1+η or β = √η(2+η) / (1+η)\nHere β=v/c of pion. Hence time dilation factor is 1+η and the distance traversed by the pion in its lifetime will be\nl = cβ(1+η)τ₀ = cτ₀√η(2+η) = 15.0 metres\non substituting the values of various quantities. (Note. The factor 1/√1-β² can be looked at as a time dilation effect in the laboratory frame or as length contraction factor brought to the other side in the proper frame of the pion)."
