Assume, as usual, that n₁ < n₂. Two points are given- one above the plane S (point A ), the other under plane S (point B ). The various distances are :\nAA₁ = h₁, BB₁ = h₂, A₁B₁ = l. We must find the path from A to B which can be covered by light faster than it can cover any other hypothetical path. Clearly, this path must consist of two straight lines, viz, AO in medium 1 and OB in medium 2; the point O in the plane S has to be found.\nFirst of all, it follows from Fermat's principle that the point O must lie on the intersection of S and a plane P, which is perpendicular to S and passes through A and B.\nIndeed, let us assume that this point does not lie in the plane P; let this be point O₁ in Fig. (b). Drop the perpendicular O₁O₂ from O₁ onto P. Since AO₂ < AO₁ and BO₂ < BO₁ it is clear that the time required to traverse A O₂ B is less than that needed to cover the path A O₁ B. Thus, using Fermat's principle, we see that the first law of refraction is observed : the incident and the refracted rays lie in the same plane as the perpendicular to the interface at the point where the ray is refracted. This plane is the plane P in Fig. (b); it is called the plane of incidence.\nNow let us consider light rays in the plane of incidence Fig. (c). Designate A₁O as x and OB₁ = l-x. The time it takes a ray to travel from A to O and then from O to B is\nT = AO/v₁ + OB/v₂ = (√(h₁²+x²))/v₁ + (√(h₂²+(l-x)²))/v₂ (1)\nThe time depends on the value of x. According to Fermat's principle, the value of x must minimize the time T. At this value of x the derivative dT/dx equals zero :\ndT/dx = x/(v₁√(h₁²+x²)) - (l-x)/(v₂√(h₂²+(l-x)²)) = 0. (2)\nNow,\nx/√(h₁²+x²) = sinα, and (l-x)/√(h₂²+(l-x)²) = sinβ,\nConsequently,\nsinα/v₁ - sinβ/v₂ = 0, or sinα/sinβ = v₁/v₂\nSo, sinα/sinβ = c/n₁ / c/n₂ = n₂/n₁\nNote : Fermat himself could not use Eqn. 2. as mathematical analysis was developed later by Newton and Leibniz. To deduce the law of the refraction of light, Fermat used his own maximum and minimum method of calculus, which, in fact, corresponded to the subsequently developed method of finding the minimum (maximum) of a function by differentiating it and equating the derivative to zero."

    "Answers": "5.177 In a uniaxial crystal, an unpolarized beam of light (or even a polarized one) splits up into O (for ordinary) and E (for extraordinary) light waves. The direction of vibration in the O and E waves are most easily specified in terms of the O and E principal planes. The principal plane of the ordinary wave is defined as the plane containing the O ray and the optic axis. Similarly the principal plane of the E wave is the plane containing the E ray and the optic axis. In terms of these planes the following is true : The O vibrations are perpendicular to the principal plane of the O ray while the E vibrations are in the principal plane of the E ray.\nWhen we apply this definition to the wollaston prism we find the following :\n(exaggerated.)\nWhen unpolarized light enters from the left the O and E waves travel in the same direction but with different speeds. The O ray on the left has its vibrations normal to the plane of the paper and it becomes E ray on crossing the diagonal boundary of the two prism similarly the E ray on the left becomes O ray on the right. In this case Snell's law is applicable only approximately. The two rays are incident on the boundary at an angle θ and in the right prism the ray which we have called O ray on the right emerges at\nsin⁻¹(n₀sinθ) = sin⁻¹(1.658/1.486 x 1/2) = 33.91°\nwhere we have used nₑ = 1.1658, n₀ = 1.486 and θ = 30°.\nSimilarly the E ray on the right emerges within the prism at\nsin⁻¹(n₀sinθ/nₑ) = sin⁻¹(0/nₑ) = 26.62°\nThis means that the O ray is incident at the boundary between the prism and air at 33.91 - 30 = 3.91°\nand will emerge into air with a deviation of\nsin⁻¹(n₀sin3.91°) = 6.49°\nThe E ray will emerge with an opposite deviation of\nsin⁻¹(nₑsin(30°-26.62°)) = sin⁻¹(1.486sin3.38°) = 5.03°\nHence δ = 6.49° + 5.03° = 11.52°\nThis result is accurate to first order in (nₑ-n₀) because Snell's law holds when nₑ=n₀."

    "Answers": "5.275 When light of sufficiently short wavelength falls on the ball, photoelectrons are ejected and the copper ball gains positive charge. The charged ball tends to resist further emission of electrons by attracting them. When the copper ball has enough charge even the most energetic electrons are unable to leave it. We can calculate this final maximum potential of the copper ball. It is obviously equal in magnitude (in volt) to the maximum K.E of electrons (in electron volts) initially emitted.

    "Answers": "5.278 A simple application of Einstein's equation\n1/2 mv_max² = hν - hν₀ = 2πħc/λ - A_cs\ngives incorrect result in this case because the photoelectrons emitted by the Cesium electrode are retarded by the small electric field that exists between the cesium electrode and the Copper electrode even in the absence of external emf. This small electric field is caused by the contact potential difference whose magnitude equals the difference of work functions\n1/e(A_cu - A_cs) volts.\nIts physical origin is explained below.\nThe maximum velocity of the photoelectrons reaching the copper electrode is then\n1/2 mv_m² = 1/2 mv₀² - (A_cu - A_cs) = 2πħc/λ - A_cu\nHere v₀ is the maximum velocity of the photoelectrons immediately after emission. Putting the values we get, on using A_cu = 4.47 eV, λ = 0.22 μm,\nv_m = 6.41 x 10⁵ m/s\nThe origin of contact potential difference is the following. Inside the metals free electrons can be thought of as a Fermi gas which occupy energy levels upto a maximum called the Fermi energy E_F. The work function A measures the depth of the Fermi level.\nWhen two metals 1 & 2 are in contact, electrons flow from one to the other till their Fermi levels are the same.

    "Answers": "5.282 (a) Compton scattering is the scattering of light by free electrons. (The free electrons are the electrons whose binding is much smaller than the typical energy transfer to the electrons). For this reason the increase in wavelength Δλ is independent of the nature of the scattered substance.\n(b) This is because the effective number of free electrons increases in both cases. With increasing angle of scattering, the energy transfered to electrons increases. With diminishing atomic number of the substance the binding energy of the electrons decreases.\n(c) The presence of a non-displaced component in the scattered radiation is due to scattering from strongy bound (inner) electrons as well as nuclei.
