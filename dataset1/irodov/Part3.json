    "Answers": "When the capactior which is immersed in water is connected to a constant voltage source, it gets charged. Suppose σ₀ is the free charge density on the condenser plates. Because water is a dielectric, bound charges also appear in it. Let σ' be the surface density of bound charges. (Because of homogeneity of the medium and uniformity of the field when we ignore edge effects no volume density of bound charges exists.) The electric field due to free charges only ε₀E₀; that due to bound charges is σ'/ε₀ and the total electric field is εE₀. Recalling that the sign of bound charges is opposite of the free charges, we have\nεE₀ = (σ₀/ε₀) - (σ'/ε₀) or, σ' = (ε-1)/ε * σ₀²\nBecause of the field that exists due to the free charges (not the total field; the field due to the bound charges must be excluded for this purpose as they only give rise to self energy effects), there is a force attracting the bound charges to the near by plates. This force is\n(1/2)σ₀' = (ε-1)σ₀² / (2εε₀) per unit area.\nThe factor 1/2 needs an explanation. Normally the force on a test charge is qE in an electric field E. But if the charge itself is produced by the electric filed then the force must be constructed bit by bit and is\nF = ∫ q(E') dE'\nif q(E') ∝ E' then we get F = (1/2)q(E)E\nThis factor of 1/2 is well known. For example the energy of a dipole of moment p⃗ in an electric field E₀ is -p⃗⋅E⃗₀ while the energy per unit volume of a linear dielectric in an electric field is - (1/2)P⃗⋅E⃗₀ where P⃗ is the polarization vector (i.e. dipole moment per unit volume). Now the force per unit area manifests ifself as excess pressure of the liquid.\nNoting that V = εdE₀\nΔp = (ε₀ε(ε-1)V² / 2d²)\nSubstitution, using ε=81 for water, gives Δp = 7.17 k Pa = 0.07 atm."

    "Answers": "In a solenoid, the inductance L = μ₀n²V = μ₀(N²/l²)Sl,\nwhere S = area of cross section, l = its length, V=Sl, N=nl = total number of turns.\nWhen the length of the solenoid is increased, for example, by pulling it, its inductance will decrease. If the current remains unchanged, the flux, linked to the solenoid, will also decrease. An induced e.m.f. will then come into play, which by Lenz's law will try to oppose the decrease of flux, for example, by increasing the current. In the superconducting state the flux will not change and so, I/l = constant\nHence, I/l = I₀/l₀, or, I = I₀l/l₀ = I₀(1+η)"

    "Answers": "The increment in energy per revolution is eΦ, so the number of revolutions is,\nN = W/eΦ\nThe distance traversed is, s = 2πrN"

    "Questions": "Demonstrate that electrons move in a betatron along a round orbit of constant radius provided the magnetic induction on the orbit is equal to half the mean value of that inside the orbit (the betatron condition).",
    "Answers": "On the one hand,\ndp/dt = eE = e/2πr d/dt ∫(from 0 to r) 2πr'B(r')dr'\nOn the other, p = B(r)er, r = constant.\ndp/dt = er dB(r)/dt\nSo, er dB(r)/dt = e/2πr d/dt <B>πr² = er/2 d<B>/dt\nHence, B(r) = (1/2)<B>\nThis equations is most easily satisfied by taking B(r₀) = (1/2)<B>.\nB(r₀) = (1/2)<B> = (1/2π)∫(from 0 to r₀) B⋅2πrdr/πr₀²"

    "Answers": "The condition, B(r₀) = (1/2)<B> = (1/2r₀²)∫(from 0 to r₀) B(r)rdr\nor, B(r₀) = (1/r₀²)∫(from 0 to r₀) B(r)rdr\nIn the present case,\nB₀-ar₀² = (1/r₀²)∫(from 0 to r₀)(B₀-ar²)rdr = (1/r₀²)(B₀r₀²/2 - ar₀⁴/4)\nor, (3/4)ar₀² = (1/2)B₀ or r₀ = √(2B₀/3a)."

    "Questions": "Using the betatron condition, demonstrate that the strength of the eddy-current field has the extremum magnitude on an equilibrium orbit.",
    "Answers": "The induced electric field (or eddy current field) is given by,\nE(r) = (1/2πr)d/dt∫(from 0 to r) 2πr'B(r')dr'\nHence, dE/dr = -(1/2πr²)d/dt∫(from 0 to r) 2πr'B(r')dr' + (1/r)dB(r)/dt\n= -(1/r)d/dt <B> + (1/r)dB(r)/dt\nThis vanishes for r=r₀ by the betatron condition, where r₀ is the radius of the equilibrium orbit."

    "Answers": "From the betatron condition,\n(1/2)d<B>/dt = dB(r₀)/dt = B/Δt\nThus, d<B>/dt = 2B/Δt\nand dΦ/dt = πr²d<B>/dt = 2πr²B/Δt\nSo, energy increment per revolution is,\ne dΦ/dt = 2πr²eB/Δt"
