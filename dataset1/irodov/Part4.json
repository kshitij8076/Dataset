The mechanical energy of the body m in the field generated by the joint action of both the gravity force and the elastic force is conserved i.e. ΔE = 0. During the motion of the body m from the initial to the final (position of maximum compression of the spring) position ΔT = 0, and therefore ΔU = ΔU_gr + ΔU_sp = 0\nor -mg(h+x) + 1/2κx² = 0\nOn solving the quadratic equation :\nx = mg/κ ± √[m²g²/κ² + 2mgh/κ]\nAs minus sign is not acceptable\nx = mg/κ + √[m²g²/κ² + 2mgh/κ]\nIf the body m were at rest on the spring, the corresponding position of m will be its equilibrium position and at this position the resultant force on the body m will be zero. Therefore the equilibrium compression Δx (say) due to the body m will be given by\nκΔx = mg or Δx = mg/κ\nTherefore seperation between the equilibrium position and one of the extreme position i.e. the sought amplitude\na = x - Δx = √[m²g²/κ² + 2mgh/κ]\nThe mechanical energy of oscillation which is conserved equals E = U_extreme ,because at the extreme position kinetic energy becomes zero.\nAlthough the weight of body m is a conservative force, it is not restoring in this problem, hence U_extreme is only concerned with the spring force. Therefore\nE = U_extreme = 1/2κa² = mgh + m²g²/2k"

    "Questions": "A pendulum is constructed as a light thin-walled sphere of radius R filled up with water and suspended at the point O from a light rigid rod (Fig. 4.11). The distance between the point O and the centre of the sphere is equal to l. How many times will the small oscillations of such a pendulum change after the water freezes? The viscosity of water and the change of its volume on freezing are to be neglected.",
    "Answers": "If water has frozen, the system consisting of the light rod and the frozen water in the hollow sphere constitute a compound (physical) pendulum to a very good approximation because we can take the whole system to be rigid. For such systems the time period is given by\nT₁ = 2π√(I/mgl) = 2π√[ (ml² + I_c) / (mgl) ] = 2π√(l/g)√[1 + k²/l²] where k² = 2/5 R² is the radius of gyration of the sphere.\nThe situation is different when water is unfrozen. When dissipative forces (viscosity) are neglected, we are dealing with ideal fluids. Such fluids instantaneously respond to (unbalanced) internal stresses. Suppose the sphere with liquid water actually executes small rigid oscillations. Then the portion of the fluid above the centre of the sphere will have a greater acceleration than the portion below the centre because the linear acceleration of any element is in this case, equal to angular acceleration of the element multiplied by the distance of the element from the centre of suspension (Recall that we are considering small oscillations). Then, as is obvious in a frame moving with the centre of mass, there will appear an unbalanced couple (not negated by any pseudoforces) which will cause the fluid to move rotationally so as to destroy differences in acceleration. Thus for this case of ideal fluids the pendulum must move in such a way that the elements of the fluid all undergo the same acceleration. This implies that we have a simple (mathematical) pendulum with the time period :\nT₀ = 2π√(l/g)\nThus T₁ = T₀√(1 + 2/5 (R/l)²)\n(One expects that a liquid with very small viscosity will have a time period close T₀ while one with high viscosity will have a time period closer to T₁.)"
