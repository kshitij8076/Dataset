They cross (a shock forms) when two infinitesimally close characteristics intersect. This happens when dx/dx₀ = 0. Differentiating x = x₀ + f(x₀)t with respect to x₀ gives dx/dx₀ = 1 + f'(x₀)t. A shock first forms at the minimum time t > 0 for which this is zero. This time is t_break = -1 / min(f'(x₀)). This only occurs if there is a region where f'(x₀) < 0 (a compression wave)."

Use the anticommutator identity {γ^ν, γ^μ} = 2g^νμ. The term γ^νγ^μ can be split into symmetric and antisymmetric parts. The antisymmetric part cancels due to ∂_ν∂_μ being symmetric. The symmetric part gives -g^νμ ∂_ν∂_μ ψ - m²ψ = 0, which is exactly (-∂^μ∂_μ - m²)ψ = 0, the Klein-Gordon equation."

    "Solution": "The approach pioneered by Leray involves constructing approximate solutions (e.g., by the Galerkin method or by regularizing the equations). One then derives uniform energy estimates (a priori bounds) for these approximate solutions in suitable function spaces (like L^∞(0,T; L²) ∩ L²(0,T; H¹)). Finally, using compactness theorems (like Aubin-Lions), one extracts a subsequence that converges weakly to a limit, which is then shown to be a weak solution. The problem is that these estimates are not strong enough to guarantee uniqueness or regularity (smoothness)."

    "Solution": "Landau damping is a mechanism for the damping of longitudinal space-charge waves in a collisionless plasma, even though the system is time-reversible. It is not due to friction but is a purely kinetic effect. Energy is transferred from the wave to particles in the plasma that are moving at nearly the same velocity as the wave's phase velocity. This resonant interaction leads to a decay of the wave's macroscopic electric field."

One equation is solved for part of the solution on a space where the linearized operator is invertible. This solution is then substituted into the second, lower-dimensional 'bifurcation equation' defined on the kernel of the linearized operator.

It's found by substituting the exact solution of the PDE into the numerical scheme. Discretization Error (or Global Error) is the actual error of the numerical solution at a certain time, which is an accumulation of the LTE over all previous steps.

    "Solution": "Use Laplace transform: (s²+1)Y(s) = 1 - e^(-πs). So Y(s) = 1/(s²+1) - e^(-πs)/(s²+1). The inverse transform of 1/(s²+1) is sin(t). The e^(-πs) term causes a shift. So y(t) = sin(t) - H(t-π)sin(t-π). Since sin(t-π)=-sin(t), this is y(t) = sin(t) + H(t-π)sin(t). For t>π, y(t)=2sin(t)."

Integrating gives arctan(v) - (1/2)ln(1+v²) = ln|x|+C. Initial condition y(1)=0 means v=0 when x=1. So 0-0=0+C, C=0. The implicit solution is arctan(y/x) = (1/2)ln(1+(y/x)²) + ln|x|."

The equation becomes v+xv' = v ± √(v²-4). So xv' = ±√(v²-4). Separating gives dv/√(v²-4) = ±dx/x. Integrating gives arccosh(v/2) = ±ln|x|+C. v/2 = cosh(±ln|x|+C). y/2x = cosh(ln(x^±1)+C)."

Substitute this into the first equation: (x-2x)² + y² = (2x)²/2. This gives (-x)²+y² = 4x²/2 = 2x². So x²+y²=2x², which means y²=x². The envelope is the pair of lines y=x and y=-x."

We need to eliminate t and s. x-y = sin(s)-cos(s). x+y=2t+sin(s)+cos(s). This becomes complicated. A simpler geometric approach: the solution u is constant along characteristics x-y=const. Let C=x-y. The value of u is determined by where the characteristic intersects the unit circle. This is not how to use characteristics. u(x,y) = x+f(y-x). u(sin s, cos s) = sin s + f(cos s - sin s) = 1. This functional equation for f is very hard. There's a simpler way. du/dt=1 along characteristics means u increases linearly with time. u=t+u₀. u(x,y)=x+y is not a solution.
