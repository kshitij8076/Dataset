    "Questions": "Two vertical communicating cylinders of different diameters contain a gas at a constant temperature under pistons of mass m₁ = 1 kg and m₂ = 2 kg. The cylinders are in vacuum, and the pistons are at the same height h₀ = 0.2 m. What will be the difference h in their heights if the mass of the first piston is made as large as the mass of the second piston?",
    "Answers": "2.1. Since the vertical cylinders are communicating vessels, the equilibrium sets in after the increase in the mass of the first piston only when it \"sinks\" to the bottom of its cylinder, i.e. the whole of the gas flows to the second cylinder. Since the temperature and pressure of the gas remain unchanged, the total volume occupied by the gas must remain unchanged. Hence we conclude that S₁h₀ + S₂h₀ = S₂h, where S₁ and S₂ are the cross-sectional areas of the first and second cylinders, and h is the height at which the second piston will be located, i.e. just the required difference in heights (since the first piston lies at the bottom). The initial pressures produced by the pistons are equal. Therefore,\n(m₁g)/S₁ = (m₂g)/S₂,\nS₁/S₂ = m₁/m₂\nand hence\nh = h₀(m₁/m₂ + 1) = 0.3 m."

    "Answers": "2.2. If the temperature T_wall of the vessel walls coincides with the gas temperature T, a molecule striking the wall changes the normal component pₓ of its momentum by -pₓ. Consequently, the total change in the momentum is 2pₓ. When T_wall > T, the gas is heated. This means that gas molecules bounce off the wall at a higher velocity than that at which they impinge on the wall, and hence have a higher momentum. As a result, the change in the momentum will be larger than 2pₓ (Fig. 197).\nIf, however, T_wall < T, the gas is cooled, i.e. gas molecules bounce off the wall with a smaller momentum than that with which they impinge on the wall. In this case, the change in the momentum will be obviously smaller than 2pₓ (Fig. 198).\n[Image of Fig. 197 and Fig. 198]\nSince according to Newton's second law, the change in momentum is proportional to the mean force, the pressure exerted by the gas on the walls is higher when the walls are warmer than the gas."

According to the first law of thermodynamics, the amount of heat ΔQ₁ received by a gas going over from state 1 (p₀, V₀) to state 2 (p₁, V₁) (Fig. 199) is\nΔQ₁ = ΔU₁ + A₁,\nwhere ΔU₁ is the change in its internal energy, and A₁ is the work done by the gas,\nA₁ = ( (p₀ + p₁)(V₁ - V₀) ) / 2.\nAs the gas goes over from state 1 to state 3 (p₂, V₂) (points 2 and 3 lie on the same isotherm), the following relations are fulfilled:\nΔQ₂ = ΔU₂ + A₂,\nA₂ = ( (p₀ + p₂)(V₂ - V₀) ) / 2.\nSince the final temperature of the gas in states 2 and 3 is the same, ΔU₁ = ΔU₂.

We note that the change in pressure Δp is connected with the change in altitude Δh through the following relation:\nΔp = -ρg Δh, (1)\nwhere ρ is the gas density. The equation of state for an ideal gas implies that p = (ρ/μ)RT (here T is the gas temperature at the point where the change in pressure is considered).

    "Answers": "2.9. Since the piston has been displaced by h under the action of the load, the volume of the gas has decreased by hS and has become V - hS. The gas pressure under the piston is equal to the atmospheric pressure p₀ plus the pressure Mg/S produced by the load, i.e. p₀ + Mg/S.

(2)\nHere T₁ and T_f are the initial and final temperatures of the gas. Since the gas is thermally insulated by hypothesis, it follows from the first law of thermodynamics that the entire work A done on the gas is spent to change its internal energy, i.e. A = (3/2)nR(T_f - T₁) (the internal energy of a mole of an ideal gas is U = (3/2)RT).

Equating these two expressions for q, we obtain\nT⁴ = (α/β)R.\nConsequently, the fourth power of the temperature of the object is proportional to its radius, and hence a decrease in radius by half leads to a decrease in temperature only by a factor of ⁴√2 ≈ 1.19."

The entire system is thermally insulated from the ambient. A liquid of density ρ and specific heat c is pumped at a velocity v through the tubes. The initial temperatures of the liquid in the heat exchanger are T_i1 and T_i2 respectively.

    "Answers": "2.18*. For definiteness, we shall assume that the liquid flowing in the inner tube 2 is cooled, i.e. T_i2 > T_f2, and hence T_i1 < T_f1. Since the cross-sectional area 2S - S = S of the liquid flow in the outer tube 1 is equal to the cross-sectional area S of the liquid flow in the inner tube 2, and their velocities coincide, the decrease in temperature of the liquid flowing in tube 2 from the entrance to the exit is equal to the decrease in temperature of the liquid flowing in tube 1. In other words, the temperature difference in the liquids remains constant along the heat exchanger, and hence\nT_i2 - T_f1 = T_f2 - T_i1 (1)\nIn view of the constancy of the temperature difference, the rate of heat transfer is constant along the heat exchanger. The amount of heat Q transferred from the liquid flowing in tube 2 to the liquid flowing in tube 1 during a time t is\nQ = S_lat k t (T_i2 - T_i1). (2)\nHere S_lat is the lateral surface of the inner tube, S_lat = 2πrl, where r is the radius of the inner tube, i.e. πr² = S, and r = √(S/π). The amount of heat Q is spent for heating the liquid flowing in tube 1. During the time t, the mass of the liquid flowing in the outer tube 1 is m = ρvtS, and its temperature increases from T_i1 to T_f1. Consequently,\nQ = ρvtSc(T_f1 - T_i1).

As a result of redistribution, the gas pressure obviously has the maximum value at the rear (relative to the direction of motion) wall of the vessel since the acceleration a is imparted to the gas just by the force of pressure exerted by this wall. We denote this pressure by p_max. On the other hand, p_max ≤ p_sat.

    "Answers": "2.22*. It is easier to solve the problem graphically. The total pressure p in the vessel is the sum of the saturated water vapour pressure p_sat and the pressure of hydrogen p_H₂. According to the equation of state for an ideal gas, the pressure of hydrogen is\np_H₂ = (m_H₂/μ_H₂V)RT = (2×10⁻³ kg × 8.3 J/(mol·K))/(2×10⁻³ kg/mol × 2×10⁻³ m³) T = 4.15×10²T,\nwhere p_H₂ is measured in pascals. The p_H₂(T) dependence is linear. Therefore, having calculated p_H₂(T) for two values of temperature, say, for T₁=373 K, p_H₂=15.5×10⁵ Pa, T₂=453 K, p_H₂=18.8×10⁵ Pa, we plot the graph of p_H₂(T). Using the hint in the conditions of the problem, we plot the graph of the function p_sat(T). \"Composing\" the graphs of p_H₂(T) and p_sat(T), we obtain the graph of the temperature dependence of the total pressure in the vessel, p(T) (Fig. 201).

Assuming that water vapour is an ideal gas, we calculate the initial p_v1 and final p_v2 pressures of water vapour in the vessel. For this purpose, we make use of the obtained graphs. For T₁ = 380 K, the pressure of hydrogen is p_H₂ ≈ 15.5 × 10⁵ Pa, and\np_v1 = p₁ - p_H₂ ≈ 1.5×10⁵ Pa.\nFor T₂ = 440 K, p_H₂ ≈ 18 × 10⁵ Pa, and\np_v2 = p_f - p_H₂ ≈ 8×10⁵ Pa.\nLet us write the equations of state for water vapour at p_v1, T₁ and p_v2, T₂:\np_v1 V = (m_v1/μ_v)RT₁, p_v2 V = (m_v2/μ_v)RT₂,\nwhere m_v1 and m_v2 are the initial and final masses of vapour in the vessel.

The condition of equilibrium for the soap bubble film consists in that the air pressure p_bub1 is the sum of the external pressure p₁ and the excess pressure 4σ/r due to surface tension. It should be noted that there are two air-soap film interfaces in the soap bubble, each of which produces a pressure 2σ/r. For this reason, the excess pressure is 2 × 2σ/r = 4σ/r.

By hypothesis, the temperature is maintained constant, and hence (according to Boyle's law) a decrease in the volume of the bubble by a factor of eight (its radius has decreased by half) leads to an eight-fold increase in the air pressure in the bubble (it becomes 8p_bub1), so that we can write\n8p_bub1 = p₂ + 8σ/r.\nSubstituting p_bub1 into this formula from the first equation, we can finally write\np₂ = 8p₁ + 24σ/r."

For the system under consideration (vessel-water, vessel-water-ball), the heat flux per unit time q = ΔQ/Δt through the surface of contact with the ambient depends on the temperature difference:\nΔQ/Δt = αF(T_ves - T),\nwhere t is the time, T_ves is the temperature of the vessel, T is the temperature of the ambient, and F is a certain function of temperature. The coefficient α is determined by the conditions at the contact of the system under consideration with the ambient. In our case, the conditions at the contact are identical for the two vessels, and hence the coefficient α is the same in both cases. The amount of heat ΔQ lost by the vessel leads to a decrease in the temperature of the vessel by ΔT_ves.\nFor the vessel with water, we obtain\nΔQ₁ = (M_w c_w + m_ves c_ves)ΔT_ves,\nwhere M_w and c_w are the mass and specific heat of water, m_ves and c_ves are the relevant quantities for the vessel.\nFor the vessel with water and the ball, we obtain\nΔQ₂ = (M_w c_w + m_w c_w + m_b c_b)ΔT_ves,\nwhere m_b and c_b are the mass and specific heat of the ball.

The lower end of the duct is maintained at a temperature T₁ > T_melt (T_melt is the melting point of cast iron), and the upper end at a temperature T₂ < T_melt. The thermal conductivity of molten (liquid) cast iron is k times higher than that of solid cast iron. Determine the fraction of the duct filled with molten metal.",
    "Answers": "2.34. Since the lower end of the duct is maintained at a temperature T₁ which is higher than the melting point of cast iron, the cast iron at the bottom will be molten. The temperature at the interface between the molten and solid cast iron is naturally equal to the melting point T_melt.\nSince the temperatures of the upper and lower ends of the duct are maintained constant, the amount of heat transferred per unit time through the duct cross section must be the same in any region. In other words, the heat flux through the molten and solid cast iron must be the same (the brick duct is a poor heat conductor so that heat transfer through its walls can be neglected).\nThe heat flux is proportional to the thermal conductivity, the cross-sectional area, and the temperature difference per unit length. Let l₁ be the length of the lower part of the duct where the cast iron is molten, and l₂ be the length of the upper part where the cast iron is in the solid phase. Then we can write the condition of the constancy of heat flux in the form (the cross-sectional area of the duct is constant)\n(κ_liq(T₁ - T_melt))/l₁ = (κ_sol(T_melt - T₂))/l₂,\nwhere κ_liq and κ_sol are the thermal conductivities of the liquid and solid cast iron. Considering that κ_liq = kκ_sol, we obtain\nl₁ = (l₂k(T₁ - T_melt))/(T_melt - T₂).\nThe total length of the duct is l₁ + l₂. Therefore, the part of the duct occupied by the molten metal is determined from the relation\nl₁/(l₁ + l₂) = (k(T₁ - T_melt))/(k(T₁ - T_melt) + (T_melt - T₂))."

    "Questions": "The shell of a space station is a blackened sphere in which a temperature T=500 K is maintained due to the operation of appliances of the station. The amount of heat given away from a unit surface area is proportional to the fourth power of thermodynamic temperature. Determine the temperature T_x of the shell if the station is enveloped by a thin spherical black screen of nearly the same radius as the radius of the shell.",
    "Answers": "2.35*. The total amount of heat Q emitted in space per unit time remains unchanged since it is determined by the energy liberated during the operation of the appliances of the station. Since only the outer surface of the screen emits into space (this radiation depends only on its temperature), the temperature of the screen must be equal to the initial temperature T = 500 K of the station. However, the screen emits the same amount of heat Q inwards. This radiation reaches the envelope of the station and is absorbed by it. Therefore, the total amount of heat supplied to the station per unit time is the sum of the heat Q liberated during the operation of the appliances and the amount of heat Q absorbed by the inner surface of the screen, i.e. is equal to 2Q. According to the heat balance condition, the same amount of heat must be emitted, and hence\nQ/2Q = T⁴/T_x⁴\nwhere T_x is the required temperature of the envelope of the station. Finally, we obtain\nT_x = ⁴√2 T ≈ 600 K."

    "Answers": "2.36. It follows from the graph (see Fig. 67) that during the first 50 minutes the temperature of the mixture does not change and is equal to 0 °C. The amount of heat received by the mixture from the room during this time is spent to melt ice. In 50 minutes, the whole ice melts and the temperature of water begins to rise. In 10 minutes (from τ₁ = 50 min to τ₂ = 60 min), the temperature increases by ΔT = 2 °C. The heat supplied to the water from the room during this time is q = c_w m_w ΔT = 84 kJ. Therefore, the amount of heat received by the mixture from the room during the first 50 minutes is Q = 5q = 420 kJ. This amount of heat was spent for melting ice of mass m_ice: Q = λm_ice. Thus, the mass of the ice contained in the bucket brought in the room is\nm_ice = Q/λ ≈ 1.2 kg."

    "Questions": "The properties of a nonlinear resistor were investigated in a series of experiments. At first, the temperature dependence of the resistor was studied. As the temperature was raised to T₁ = 100 °C, the resistance changed jumpwise from R₁ = 50 Ω to R₂ = 100 Ω. The reverse abrupt change upon cooling took place at T₂ = 99 °C. Then a d.c. voltage U₁ = 60 V was applied to the resistor. Its temperature was found to be T₃ = 80 °C. Finally, when a d.c. voltage U₂ = 80 V was applied to the resistor, spontaneous current oscillations were observed in the circuit. The air temperature T₀ in the laboratory was constant and equal to 20 °C. The heat transfer from the resistor was proportional to the temperature difference between the resistor and the ambient, the heat capacity of the resistor being C = 3 J/K. Determine the period T of current oscillations and the maximum and minimum values of the current.",
    "Answers": "2.37*. We denote by α the proportionality factor between the power dissipated in the resistor and the temperature difference between the resistor and the ambient. Since the resistance of the resistor is R₁ at T₃ = 80 °C, and the voltage across it is U₁, the dissipated power is U₁²/R₁, and we can write\nU₁²/R₁ = α(T₃ - T₀). (1)\nThe temperature of the resistor rises with the applied voltage since the heat liberated by the current increases. As the temperature becomes equal to T₁ = 100 °C, the resistance of the resistor abruptly increases twofold. The heat liberated in it will decrease, and if the voltage is not very high, the heat removal turns out to be more rapid than the liberation of heat. This leads to a temperature drop to T₂ = 99 °C, which will cause an abrupt change in the resistance to its previous value, and the process will be repeated. Therefore, current oscillations caused by the jumpwise dependence of the resistance on temperature will emerge in the circuit.\nDuring these oscillations, the temperature of the resistor is nearly constant (it varies between T₂ = 99 °C and T₁ = 100 °C) so that we can assume that the heat removal is constant, and the removed power is α(T₁ - T₀). Then, by introducing the time t₁ of heating (from 99 °C to 100 °C), the time t₂ of cooling, and the oscillation period T = t₁ + t₂, we can write the heat balance equations:\n(U₂²t₁)/R₁ = α(T₁ - T₀)t₁ + C(T₁ - T₂),\n(U₂²t₂)/R₂ = α(T₁ - T₀)t₂ - C(T₁ - T₂). (2)\nUsing the value of α obtained from Eq. (1), we find that\nt₁ = C(T₁-T₂)/[U₂²/R₁ - U₁²(T₁-T₀)/[R₁(T₃-T₀)]],\nt₂ = C(T₁-T₂)/[U₁²(T₁-T₀)/[R₁(T₃-T₀)] - U₂²/R₂].\nSubstituting the numerical values of the quantities, we obtain t₁ = t₂ = 3/32 s ≈ 0.1 s and T ≈ 0.2 s.\nThe maximum and minimum values of the current can easily be determined since the resistance abruptly changes from R₁ = 50 Ω to R₂ = 100 Ω in the process of oscillations. Consequently,\nI_max = U₂/R₁ = 1.6 A, I_min = U₂/R₂ = 0.8 A.\nIt should be noted that the situation described in the problem corresponds to a first-order phase transition in the material of the resistor. As a result of heating, the material goes over to a new phase at T₁ = 100 °C (this transition can be associated, for example, with the rearrangement of the crystal lattice of the resistor material). The reverse transition occurs at a lower temperature T₂ = 99 °C. This phenomenon is known as hysteresis and is typical of first-order phase transitions."

    "Answers": "2.38. Raindrops falling on the brick at first form a film on its surface (Fig. 204). The brick has a porous structure, and the pores behave like capillaries. Due to surface tension, water is sucked into pores-capillaries. The capillaries are interconnected and have various sizes, the number of narrow capillaries being larger. The force of surface tension sucking water in wide capillaries is weaker than the force acting in narrow capillaries. For this reason, the water film in wide capillaries will bulge and break. This phenomenon is responsible for the hissing sounds.\n[Image of Fig. 204]"

Determine the work A done by the gas thereby if the atmospheric pressure is p₀=10⁵ Pa, the density of mercury is ρ_mer = 13.6 × 10³ kg/m³, and the cross-sectional area of the tube is S = 1 cm².\n[Image of Fig. 68]",
    "Answers": "2.39. The work A done by the gas is the sum of two components, viz. the work A₁ done against the force of atmospheric pressure and the work A₂ done against the force of gravity. The mercury-gas interface is shifted upon the complete displacement of mercury by 2l + l/2 = (5/2)l, and hence\nA₁ = (5/2)p₀Sl.\nThe work A₂ done against the force of gravity is equal to the change in the potential energy of mercury as a result of its displacement. The whole of mercury rises as a result of displacement by l relative to the horizontal part of the tube. This quantity should be regarded as the final height of the centre of mass of mercury. The initial position of the centre of mass of mercury is obviously h₀ = l/8. Hence we can conclude that\nA₂ = Mg(l - l/8) = (7/8)Mgl,\nwhere M = 2lSρ_mer is the mass of mercury. Finally, we obtain\nA = A₁ + A₂ = (5/2)p₀Sl + (7/4)ρ_mer gSl² ≈ 7.7 J."

    "Questions": "The residual deformation of an elastic rod can be roughly described by using the following model. If the elongation of the rod Δl < x₀ (where x₀ is the quantity present for the given rod), the force required to cause the elongation Δl is determined by Hooke's law: F = k Δl, where k is the rigidity of the rod. If Δl > x₀, the force does not depend on elongation any longer (the material of the rod starts \"flowing\"). If the load is then removed, the elongation of the rod will decrease along CD which for the sake of simplicity will be taken straight and parallel to the segment AB (Fig. 69). Therefore, after the load has been removed completely, the rod remains deformed (point D in the figure). Let us suppose that the rod is initially stretched by Δl = x > x₀ and then the load is removed.
