    "Questions": "A point light source S is on the axis of a hollow cone with a mirror inner surface (Fig. 115). A converging lens produces on a screen the image of the source formed by the rays undergoing a single reflection at the inner surface (direct rays from the source do not fall on the lens). What will happen to the image if the lens is covered by diaphragms like those shown in Figs. 116 and 117?\n[Image of Fig. 115]\n[Image of Fig. 116]\n[Image of Fig. 117]",
    "Answers": "4.1. Rays which are singly reflected from the mirror surface of the cone propagate as if they were emitted by an aggregate of virtual point sources arranged on a circle. Each such source is symmetrical to the source S about the corresponding generator of the cone. The image of these sources on a screen is a ring. It is essential that the beam of rays incident on the lens from a virtual source is plane: it does not pass through the entire surface of the lens but intersects it along its diameter. Therefore, the extent to which such a beam is absorbed by a diaphragm depends on the shape and orientation of the latter.\nA symmetrical annular diaphragm (see Fig. 116) absorbs the beams from all virtual sources to the same extent. In this case, the illuminance of the ring on the screen will decrease uniformly. The diaphragm shown in Fig. 117 will completely transmit the beams whose planes form angles α < α₀ with the vertical. Consequently, the illuminance of the upper and lower parts of the ring on the screen will remain unchanged. Other beams will be cut by the diaphragm the more, the closer the plane of a beam to the horizontal plane. For this reason, the illuminance of the lateral regions of the ring will decrease as the angle α varies between α₀ and π/2."

Estimate the minimum size of the screen that should be placed behind the lens so that the entire field of view is covered. Where should the screen be placed? Assume that the radius r of the pupil is approximately 1.5 mm.",
    "Answers": "4.2. Let us first neglect the size of the pupil, assuming that it is point-like. Obviously, only those of the beams passing through the lens will get into the eye which have passed through point B before they fall on the lens (Fig. 226). This point is conjugate to the point at which the pupil is located.\nThe distance b from the lens to point B can be calculated by using the formula for a thin lens:\n1/F = 1/a + 1/b, b = aF/(a-F) = 12 cm.\nIt is clear now that the screen must coincide with the real image of the pupil in the plane S. Figure 226 shows that the minimum radius of the screen is\nR = (b/a)r ≈ 0.5 mm,\nand the screen must be placed in the plane S with its centre at point B."

The dependence of the refractive index n of the gas on its density ρ obeys the law n = 1 + αρ. The vessel is rotated at an angular velocity ω about its axis. A narrow parallel beam of light of radius r_beam is incident along the axis of the vessel. Determine the radius R of the spot on the screen placed at right angles to the vessel axis at a distance L behind the vessel, assuming that the change in the gas pressure at each point of the vessel due to rotation is small as compared with p₀. The effect of the end faces of the vessel on the path of the rays should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "4.3*. Let us first determine the distribution of the gas pressure near the axis of the vessel. We shall consider the volume element ΔrΔS of the gas (Fig. 227). The centripetal acceleration a = ω²r of this element is ensured by the difference in the corresponding pressures:\n[p(r + Δr) - p(r)]ΔS = ρΔrΔSω²r.\nTherefore, for the variation of pressure, we obtain the following equation:\ndp/dr = ρω²r.\nSince the relation μp = ρRT is satisfied for an ideal gas (R is the universal gas constant), we obtain\ndp/dr = p(μω²/RT)r.\nBy hypothesis, for r ≤ r_beam, we have p(r) - p₀ << p₀, and hence\np(r) ≈ p₀(1 + (μω²r²)/(2RT)).\nAccordingly, for the gas density at r ≤ r_beam, we obtain\nρ(r) ≈ ρ₀(1 + (μω²r²)/(2RT)), ρ₀ = p₀μ/RT,\nand for the refractive index, we get\nn(r) = n₀ + kr², n₀ = 1 + αρ₀, k = (αρ₀/2)(μω/RT)².\nLet us now find the angle of refraction of a ray passing through the vessel at a distance r from the axis. The optical path length in the vessel is n(r)l.\nThe optical path difference δ_opt between two close rays emerging from the vessel must be equal to the geometrical path difference δ due to the deflection of the rays from the initial direction of propagation. In this case, the interference of the rays will result in their augmentation (Huygens' principle). It follows from Fig. 228 that\nδ_opt = [n(r + Δr) - n(r)]l, δ = Δr sin φ.\nHence\nsin φ = δ/Δr = ([n(r + Δr) - n(r)]l)/Δr ≈ 2klr.\nThis leads to the following conclusion. If we consider a narrow beam of light such that the deflection angle φ is small, then φ ∝ r, i.e. the rotating vessel will act as a diverging lens with a focal length F = (2kl)⁻¹.\nTherefore, for the maximum deflection angle, we obtain\nsin φ_max = 2klr_beam.\nConsequently, the required radius of the spot on the screen is\nR = r_beam + L tan φ_max.\nIn the diverging lens approximation, we obtain\nR ≈ r_beam + Lφ_max ≈ r_beam + 2klr_beam L = r_beam[1 + αp₀lL((μω)/(RT))²]."

    "Questions": "A telescope with an angular magnification k = 20 consists of two converging thin lenses, viz. an objective with a focal length F = 0.5 m and an eyepiece which can be adjusted to the eye within the limits between D_ = -7 D and D+ = +10 D (during the adjustment, the eyepiece is displaced relative to the objective). What is the smallest possible distance a from the objective starting from which remote objects can be viewed by an unstrained normal eye through this telescope?",
    "Answers": "4.4. The telescope considered in the problem is of the Kepler type. The angular magnification k = F/f, and hence the focal length of the eyepiece is f = F/k = 2.5 cm. As the object being observed approaches the observer from infinity to the smallest possible distance a, the image of the object formed by the objective will be displaced from the focal plane towards the eyepiece by a distance x which can be determined from the formula for a thin lens:\n1/a + 1/(F+x) = 1/F, 1/(F+x) = (a-F)/(aF)\nx = aF/(a-F) - F ≈ F²/a\nsince a >> F. Thus, we must find x. The eyepiece of the telescope is a magnifying glass. When an object is viewed through a magnifier by the unstrained eye (accommodated to infinity), the object must be placed in the focal plane of the magnifier. The required distance x is equal to the displacement of the focal plane of the eyepiece during its adjustment. In this case, the eyepiece must obviously be moved away from the objective.\nFigure 229 shows that when an infinitely remote object is viewed from the shifted eyepiece, the light beam will converge at the exit. When a parallel beam of rays is incident on the telescope, such a position of the eyepiece is required for a long-sighted person whose eye has an insufficient focal power for converging the parallel beam on the retina. The maximum shift of the eyepiece corresponds to the focal power D+ = +10 D. The spectacles of such a focal power converge a parallel beam at a distance b = 1/D+. This distance b just determines the displacement x:\n1/(f+x) + 1/b = 1/f,\nwhence\nx = f²/(b-f) = 5/6 cm.\nThe required distance is\na ≈ F²/x = (0.25 × 6 m²)/(5 × 10⁻² m) = 30 m."

    "Answers": "4.7. The answer follows from Fig. 233. The first bright ring is formed by the rays which undergo one reflection from the body before they leave it (such a ray is marked by 1). The second bright ring is formed by the rays undergoing two reflections (such a ray is marked by 2), and so on. Clearly, the larger the number of reflections, the more the light absorbed by the body of the ballpoint pen. Therefore, the further a bright ring from the centre, the lower its brightness."

A transparent cylinder is arranged between the source and the screen (Fig. 118). The refractive index of the cylinder material is n = 1.5, the cylinder length is l = 1 m, and the diameter is the same as that of the hole. What will be the change in the luminous flux through the hole? Neglect the absorption of light in the substance.",
    "Answers": "4.8. Let us prove that after refraction all the rays emerging from the point source towards the screen will lie within the cylinder, and after multiple reflections from the lateral surface of the cylinder, will ultimately pass through the hole in the screen.\nIndeed, the extreme ray from the point source S, whose angle of incidence on the left base of the cylinder is π/2, after refraction will form an angle α with the cylinder axis such that sin α = 1/n (according to Snell's law). The angle of incidence φ of such a ray on the lateral surface of the cylinder satisfies the condition α + φ = π/2 (Fig. 234). Since\nsin α = 1/n = 1/1.5 < 1/√2,\nα < π/4 and φ > π/4, i.e. the angle of incidence on the lateral surface of the cylinder will be larger than the critical angle of total internal reflection. Therefore, this ray cannot emerge from the cylinder at any point other than that lying on the right base. Any other ray emerging from the source towards the screen with a hole and undergoing refraction at the left base of the cylinder will propagate at a smaller angle to the axis, and hence will be incident on the lateral surface at an angle exceeding the critical angle. Thus, the transparent cylinder will “converge” to the hole the rays within a solid angle of 2π sr.\nIn the absence of the cylinder, the luminous flux confined in a solid angle of πd²/(4l)² gets into the hole in the screen. Therefore, in the presence of the transparent cylinder, the luminous flux through the hole will increase by a factor of\n2π / (πd²/(4l)²) = 8 × 10⁴."

Indeed,\nr₁² = (2R₁ - h)h ≈ 2R₁h, h = r₁²/2R₁,\nwhere R₁ is the radius of curvature of the objective.\nLet us write the condition of equality of optical paths ABF and CDF for the case when the telescope is filled with water:\n(f₁ - h)n_w + 2hn_gl = n_w l₁ + h.\nHere f₁ is the focal length of the objective lens in the presence of water. Substituting the values of h and l₁ = √(f₁² + r₁²) ≈ f₁ + r₁²/(2f₁), we obtain\nr₁²/(2f₁) n_w = r₁²/(2R₁) [(n_gl - 1) + (n_gl - n_w)].\nHence\nf₁ = (R₁n_w)/((n_gl - 1) + (n_gl - n_w)).\nWhen the telescope does not contain water, the focal length of the objective lens is\nf₁⁽⁰⁾ = R₁/(2(n_gl - 1)).\nTherefore,\nf₁ = f₁⁽⁰⁾ (2(n_gl - 1)n_w)/((n_gl - 1) + (n_gl - n_w)).\nA similar calculation for the focal lengths f₂ (with water) and f₂⁽⁰⁾ (without water) of the eyepiece lens gives the following result:\nf₂ = f₂⁽⁰⁾ (2(n_gl - 1)n_w)/((n_gl - 1) + (n_gl - n_w)).\nTherefore,\nL = f₁ + f₂ = (f₁⁽⁰⁾ + f₂⁽⁰⁾) (2(n_gl - 1)n_w)/((n_gl - 1) + (n_gl - n_w)).\nSince f₁⁽⁰⁾ + f₂⁽⁰⁾ = L₀, the required distance between the objective and the eyepiece is\nL = L₀ (2(n_gl - 1)n_w)/(2n_gl - n_w - 1) = 30 cm."

    "Answers": "4.13. The light entering the camera is reflected from the surface of the façade. It can be assumed that the reflection of light from the plaster is practically independent of the angle of reflection. In this case, the luminous energy incident on the objective of the camera is proportional to the solid angle at which the façade is seen from the objective. As the distance from the object is reduced by half, the solid angle increases by a factor of four, and a luminous energy four times stronger than in the former case is incident on the objective of the same area.\nFor such large distances from the object, the distance between the objective and the film in the camera does not practically change during the focussing of the object and is equal to the focal length of the objective. The solid angle within which the energy from the objective is incident on the surface of the image depends linearly on the solid angle at which the façade is seen, i.e. on the distance from the object. In this case, the illuminance of the surface of the image (which, by hypothesis, is uniformly distributed over the area of this surface), which determines the exposure, is directly proportional to the corresponding energy incident on the objective from the façade and inversely proportional to the area of the image. Since this ratio is practically independent of the distance from the object under given conditions there is no need to change the exposure."
