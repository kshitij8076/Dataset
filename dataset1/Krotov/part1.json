    "Questions": "A body with zero initial velocity moves down an inclined plane from a height h and then ascends along the same plane with an initial velocity such that it stops at the same height h. In which case is the time of motion longer?",
    "Answers": "Let us first assume that there is no friction. Then according to the energy conservation law, the velocity v of the body sliding down the inclined plane from the height h at the foot is equal to the velocity which must be imparted to the body for its ascent to the same height h. Since for a body moving up and down an inclined plane the magnitude of acceleration is the same, the time of ascent will be equal to the time of descent.\nIf, however, friction is taken into consideration, the velocity v₁ of the body at the end of the descent is smaller than the velocity v (due to the work done against friction), while the velocity v₂ that has to be imparted to the body for raising it along the inclined plane is larger than v for the same reason. Since the descent and ascent occur with constant (although different) accelerations, and the traversed path is the same, the time t₁ of descent and the time t₂ of ascent can be found from the formulas\ns = v₁t₁/2, s = v₂t₂/2,\nwhere s is the distance covered along the inclined plane. Since the inequality v₁ < v₂ is satisfied, it follows that t₁ > t₂. Thus, in the presence of sliding friction, the time of descent from the height h is longer than the time of ascent to the same height.\nWhile solving the problem, we neglected an air drag. Nevertheless, it can easily be shown that if an air drag is present in addition to the force of gravity and the normal reaction of the inclined plane, the time of descent is always longer than the time of ascent irrespective of the type of this force. Indeed, if in the process of ascent the body attains an intermediate height h', its velocity v' at this point, required to reach the height h in the presence of drag, must be higher than the velocity in the absence of drag since a fraction of the kinetic energy will be transformed into heat during the subsequent ascent. The body sliding down from the height h and reaching the height h' will have (due to the work done by the drag force) a velocity v'' which is lower than the velocity of the body moving down without a drag. Thus, while passing by the same point on the inclined plane, the ascending body has a higher velocity than the descending body. For this reason, the ascending body will cover a small distance in the vicinity of point h' in a shorter time than the descending body. Dividing the entire path into small regions, we see that each region will be traversed by the ascending body in a shorter time than by the descending body. Consequently, the total time of ascent will be shorter than the time of descent."

    "Answers": "Since the locomotive moves with a constant deceleration after the application of brakes, it will come to rest in t = v/a = 50 s, during which it will cover a distance s = v²/(2a) = 375 m.

Since the sound can no longer be heard on the ground after a time t₂, we obtain the equation\nt₂ = t₁ + at₁²/(2c),\nwhere on the right-hand side we have the time of ascent of the helicopter to the altitude h and the time taken for the sound to reach the ground from the altitude h.

    "Answers": "We shall consider the relative motion of the bodies from the viewpoint of the first body. Then at the initial moment, the first body is at rest (it can be at rest at the subsequent instants as well), while the second body moves towards it at a velocity v₁ + v₂. Its acceleration is constant, equal in magnitude to a₁ + a₂, and is directed against the initial velocity. The condition that the bodies meet indicates that the distance over which the velocity of the second body vanishes must be longer than the separation between the bodies at the beginning of motion; hence we obtain\nlₘₐₓ = (v₁ + v₂)² / (2(a₁ + a₂))."

After the passage of time τ, the velocities of the balls coincide in magnitude and direction. Determine the time τ and the time interval during which the velocities of the two balls will be equal, assuming that the balls do not collide.",
    "Answers": "Since the balls move along the vertical, we direct the coordinate axis vertically upwards. We plot the time dependence of the projections of the velocities of the balls on this axis. Figures 122 and 123 show the dependences v₁(t) and v₂(t) respectively (the moments of the beginning of motion are not matched so far). These graphs present infinite sets of straight line segments with equal slopes (since the acceleration is the same). These segments are equidistant on the time axis, their separations being t₁ = 2√(2h₁/g) for the first ball and t₂ = 2√(2h₂/g) for the second ball. Since h₁ = 4h₂ by hypothesis, t₁ = 2t₂, i.e. the frequency of motion of the second ball is twice as high as that of the first ball. It follows from the ratio of the initial heights that the maximum velocities attained by the balls will also differ by a factor of two (see Figs. 122 and 123):\nv₁ₘₐₓ = 2v₂ₘₐₓ = √(2h₁g) = v₀.\nThere are two possibilities for the coincidence of the velocities of the balls in magnitude and direction. The velocities of the balls may coincide for the first time τ = nt₁ s after the beginning of motion (where n = 0, 1, 2, ...) during the time interval t₁/4, then they coincide 3t₁/4 s after the beginning of motion during the time interval t₁/2. Subsequently, the velocities will coincide with a period t₁ during the time interval t₁/2. The other possibility consists in that the second ball starts moving τ = t₁/2 + nt₁ s (where n = 0, 1, 2, ...) after the first ball. After t₁/4 s, the velocities of the balls coincide for the first time and remain identical during the time interval t₁/2. Subsequently, the situation is repeated with a period t₁.\nFor other starting instants for the second ball, the velocity graphs will have no common points upon superposition because of the multiplicity of the periods of motion of the balls, and the problem will have no solution."

Assuming that the impacts of the balls against the surface are perfectly elastic, prove that after the first impact each ball gets into the lowest point of the spherical surface (the balls do not collide).",
    "Answers": "Let us consider the motion of a ball falling freely from a height H near the symmetry axis starting from the moment it strikes the surface. At the moment of impact, the ball has the initial velocity v₀ = √(2gH) (since the impact is perfectly elastic), and the direction of the velocity v₀ forms an angle 2α with the vertical (Fig. 124).\nLet the displacement of the ball along the horizontal in time t after the impact be s. Then v₀ sin(2α)·t = s. Hence we obtain t = s/(√(2gH) sin(2α)), where v₀ sin(2α) is the horizontal component of the initial velocity of the ball (the ball does not strike the surface any more during the time t). The height at which the ball will be in time t is\nΔh = h₀ + v₀ cos(2α)·t - gt²/2,\nwhere v₀ cos(2α) is the vertical component of the initial velocity of the ball.\nSince the ball starts falling from the height H near the symmetry axis (the angle α is small), we can assume that h₀ ≈ 0, sin(2α) ≈ 2α, cos(2α) ≈ 1, and s ≈ Rα. Taking into account these and other relations obtained above, we find the condition for the ball to get at the lowest point on the spherical surface:\nt = s / (√(2gH) sin(2α)) = Rα / (√(2gH) 2α) = R / (2√(2gH))\nΔh ≈ v₀t - gt²/2 = R/2 - R²/(16H) = 0.\nHence H = R/8."

    "Questions": "A small ball thrown at an initial velocity v₀ at an angle α to the horizontal strikes a vertical wall moving towards it at a horizontal velocity v and is bounced to the point from which it was thrown. Determine the time t from the beginning of motion to the moment of impact, neglecting friction losses.",
    "Answers": "Since the wall is smooth, the impact against the wall does not alter the vertical component of the ball velocity. Therefore, the total time t₁ of motion of the ball is the total time of the ascent and descent of the body thrown upwards at a velocity v₀ sin α in the gravitational field. Consequently, t₁ = 2v₀ sin α/g. The motion of the ball along the horizontal is the sum of two motions. Before the collision with the wall, it moves at a velocity v₀ cos α. After the collision, it traverses the same distance backwards, but at a different velocity. In order to calculate the velocity of the backward motion of the ball, it should be noted that the velocity at which the ball approaches the wall (along the horizontal) is v₀ cos α + v. Since the impact is perfectly elastic, the ball moves away from the wall after the collision at a velocity v₀ cos α + v. Therefore, the ball has the following horizontal velocity relative to the ground:\n(v₀ cos α + v) + v = v₀ cos α + 2v.\nIf the time of motion before the impact is t, by equating the distances covered by the ball before and after the collision, we obtain the following equation:\nv₀ cos α · t = (t₁ − t)(v₀ cos α + 2v).\nSince the total time of motion of the ball is t₁ = 2v₀ sin α/g, we find that\nt = (v₀ sin α (v₀ cos α + 2v)) / (g (v₀ cos α + v))."

Determine the relation between v, H, r, and α for which the ball can \"get out\" of the well after elastic impacts with the walls. Friction losses should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "Figure 125 shows the top view of the trajectory of the ball. Since the collisions of the ball with the wall and the bottom of the well are elastic, the magnitude of the horizontal component of the ball velocity remains unchanged and equal to v. The horizontal distances between points of two successive collisions are A₁A₂ = A₂A₃ = ... = 2r cos α. The time between two successive collisions of the ball with the wall of the well is t₁ = 2r cos α/v.\nThe vertical component of the ball velocity does not change upon a collision with the wall and reverses its sign upon a collision with the bottom. The magnitude of the vertical velocity component for the first impact against the bottom is √(2gH), and the time of motion from the top to the bottom of the well is t₂ = √(2H/g). Figure 126 shows the vertical plane development of the polyhedron A₁A₂A₃... On this development, the segments of the trajectory of the ball inside the well are parabolas (complete parabolas are the segments of the trajectory between successive impacts against the bottom). The ball can \"get out\" of the well if the moment of the maximum ascent along the parabola coincides with the moment of an impact against the wall (i.e. at the moment of maximum ascent, the ball is at point Aₙ of the well edge). The time t₁ is connected to the time t₂ through the following relation:\nnt₁ = 2kt₂,\nwhere n and k are integral and mutually prime numbers. Substituting the values of t₁ and t₂, we obtain the relation between v, H, r, and α for which the ball can \"get out\" of the well:\n(nr cos α)/v = k√(2H/g)."

    "Answers": "From all possible trajectories of the shell, we choose the one that touches the shelter. Let us analyze the motion of the shell in the coordinate system with the axes directed as shown in Fig. 127.\nThe \"horizontal\" component (along the axis Ax) of the initial velocity of the shell in this system is v₀ₓ = v₀ cos(φ - α), and the \"vertical\" component (along the axis Ay) is v₀ᵧ = v₀ sin(φ - α), where φ is the angle formed by the direction of the initial velocity of the shell and the horizontal. Point C at which the trajectory of the shell touches the shelter determines the maximum altitude h' of the shell above the horizontal. Figure 127 shows that h' = l sin α. The projection of the total velocity v of the shell on the axis Ay is zero at this point, and\nh' = v₀ᵧ² / (2g')\nwhere g' = g cos α is the \"free-fall\" acceleration in the coordinate system xAy. Thus,\nv₀² sin²(φ - α) = 2gl cos α sin α.\nHence it follows, in particular, that if v₀² < 2gl cos α sin α = gl sin 2α by hypothesis, none of the shell trajectories will touch the shelter, and the maximum range Lₘₐₓ will correspond to the shell fired at an angle φ = π/4 to the horizontal. Here Lₘₐₓ = v₀²/g.\nIf v₀² ≥ gl sin 2α by hypothesis, the angle at which the shell should be fired to touch the shelter will be\nφ = φₜ = α + arcsin(√(gl sin 2α) / v₀)\nIf, moreover, the inequality v₀² / (v₀²+2gl) ≤ sin 2α is satisfied by hypothesis, which means that the condition φₜ ≥ π/4 holds (prove this!), the angle φ at which the shell having the maximum range should be fired will be equal to π/4, and Lₘₐₓ = v₀²/g. If, however, the inverse inequality v₀² / (v₀²+2gl) > sin 2α is known to be valid, which in turn means that φₜ < π/4, we have\nφ = φₜ = α + arcsin(√(gl sin 2α) / v₀),\nLₘₐₓ = (v₀²/g) sin 2φ = (v₀²/g) sin(2(α + arcsin(√(gl sin 2α) / v₀)))."

    "Answers": "Let us suppose that hail falls along the vertical at a velocity v. In the reference frame fixed to the motorcar, the angle of incidence of hailstones on the windscreen is equal to the angle of reflection. The velocity of a hailstone before it strikes the windscreen is v - v₁ (Fig. 128). Since hailstones are bounced vertically upwards (from the viewpoint of the driver) after the reflection, the angle of reflection, and hence the angle of incidence, is equal to β₁ (β₁ is the slope of the windscreen of the motorcar).

Since the distances AC and BC are constant, point C, on the one hand, can move in a circle of radius AC with the centre at point A, and on the other hand, in a circle of radius BC with the centre at point B. Therefore, the direction of velocity of point C must be perpendicular both to the straight line AC and the straight line BC. Since points A, B, and C do not lie on the same straight line, the direction of velocity at point C would be perpendicular to two intersecting straight lines AC and BC, which is impossible.

Since only the front wheels can be turned, the centre O of the circle along which the car is driven out for any manoeuvre (forward or backward) always lies on the straight line passing through the centres of the rear wheels of the car. Consequently, the car being driven out is more likely to touch the hind car during backward motion than the front car during forward motion (the centre of the corresponding circle is shifted backwards relative to the middle of the car).

When the ant is at point A at a distance l₁ = 1 m from the centre of the ant-hill, its velocity v₁ = 2 cm/s. What time will it take the ant to run from point A to point B which is at a distance l₂ = 2 m from the centre of the ant-hill?",
    "Answers": "The velocity of the ant varies with time according to a nonlinear law. Therefore, the mean velocity on different segments of the path will not be the same, and the well-known formulas for mean velocity cannot be used here.\nLet us divide the path of the ant from point A to point B into small segments traversed in equal time intervals Δt. Then Δt = Δl/vₘ(Δl), where vₘ(Δl) is the mean velocity over a given segment Δl. This formula suggests the idea of the solution of the problem: we plot the dependence of 1/vₘ(Δl) on l for the path between points A and B. The graph is a segment of a straight line (Fig. 134). The hatched area S under this segment is numerically equal to the sought time. Let us calculate this area:\nS = (1/v₁ + 1/v₂)/2 * (l₂ - l₁) = (1/(2v₁) + 1/(2v₁ * (l₁/l₂))) * (l₂ - l₁)\nsince 1/v₂ = (1/v₁) * l₂/l₁. Thus, the ant reaches point B in the time\nt = (l₂² - l₁²)/(2v₁l₁) = (4 m² - 1 m²)/(2 * 2 m/s * 10⁻² * 1 m) = 75 s."

Using the figure, determine the velocity vₗᵢₙₔ of the wind if it is known to be constant, and if the velocity vₗₒ꜀ of the locomotive is 36 km/h.",
    "Answers": "Obviously, all the segments of the smoke trace move in the horizontal direction with the velocity of wind. Let us consider the path of the locomotive in the reference frame moving with the wind (Fig. 135). Points A' and B' of the smoke trace correspond to the smoke ejected by the locomotive at points A and B of its circular path relative to the ground. Obviously, AA' || BB'. It can easily be seen that the path of the locomotive relative to the reference frame moving with the wind is the path of the point of a wheel of radius R rotating at a velocity vₗₒ꜀ and moving against the wind (to the left) at a velocity vₗᵢₙₔ. This trajectory is known as a cycloid. Depending on the ratio of velocities vₗₒ꜀ and vₗᵢₙₔ, the shape of the lower part of the path will be different. It is a loop (when vₗₒ꜀ > vₗᵢₙₔ, Fig. 136), or a parabola (when vₗₒ꜀ < vₗᵢₙₔ, Fig. 137), or a \"beak\" (when vₗₒ꜀ = vₗᵢₙₔ, Fig. 138). The latter case corresponds to the condition of our problem. Thus, the velocity of the wind is vₗᵢₙₔ = vₗₒ꜀ = 10 m/s, and in order to find its direction, we draw the tangent CC' from the point of the \"beak\" to the path of the locomotive (viz. the circle) relative to the ground."

    "Answers": "Since the hoop with the centre at point O₁ is at rest, the velocity vₐ of the upper point A of \"intersection\" of the hoops must be directed along the tangent to the circle with centre O₁ at any instant of time (Fig. 140). At any instant of time, the segment AB divides the distance d = OO₁ between the centres of the hoops into two equal parts, and hence the horizontal projection of the velocity vₐ is always equal to v/2. Consequently, the velocity vₐ forms an angle φ = π/2 - α with the horizontal and is given by\nvₐ = v / (2 cos φ) = v / (2 sin α)\nSince sin α = √(1 - cos² α) = √(1 - (d/2R)²), the velocity of the upper point of \"intersection\" of the hoops is\nvₐ = v / (2√(1 - (d/2R)²))."

Determine the time t from the beginning of motion of the body to the moment when it comes to rest.",
    "Answers": "Let us write the equation of motion for the body over the inclined plane. Let the instantaneous coordinate (the displacement of the top of the inclined plane) be x; then\nma = mg sin α - mg cos α · bx,\nwhere m is the mass of the body, and a is its acceleration. The form of the obtained equation of motion resembles that of the equation of vibratory motion for a body suspended on a spring of rigidity k = mg cos α · b in the field of the \"force of gravity\" mg sin α. This analogy with the vibratory motion helps solve the problem.\nLet us determine the position x₀ of the body for which the sum of the forces acting on it is zero. It will be the \"equilibrium position\" for the vibratory motion of the body. Obviously, mg sin α - mg cos α · bx₀ = 0. Hence we obtain x₀ = (1/b) tan α. At this moment, the body will have the velocity v₀ which can be obtained from the law of conservation of the mechanical energy of the body:\nmv₀²/2 = mg sin α·x₀ - kx₀²/2 = mg sin α·x₀ - (mgb cos α)/2 x₀²,\nv₀² = 2gx₀ sin α - gbx₀² cos α = (g/b) sin²α/cos α.\nIn its further motion, the body will be displaced again by x₀ (the \"amplitude\" value of vibrations, which can easily be obtained from the law of conservation of mechanical energy). The frequency of the corresponding vibratory motion can be found from the relation k/m = gb cos α = ω₀². Therefore, having covered the distance x₀ = (1/b) tan α after passing the \"equilibrium position\", the body comes to rest. At this moment, the restoring force \"vanishes\" since it is just the force of sliding friction. As soon as the body stops, sliding friction changes the direction and becomes static friction equal to mg sin α. The coefficient of friction between the body and the inclined plane at the point where the body stops is μₛₜ = b · 2x₀ = 2 tan α, i.e. is more than enough for the body to remain at rest.\nUsing the vibrational approach to the description of this motion, we find that the total time of motion of the body is equal to half the \"period of vibrations\". Therefore,\nt = T/2 = 2π/(2ω₀) = π/√(gb cos α)."

Then it acquires an initial velocity by a jerk. Determine the ratio of the braking lengths and braking times before the first stop and after the jerk.",
    "Answers": "The friction Fբᵣ(x) of the loaded sledge is directly proportional to the length x of the part of the sledge stuck in the sand. We write the equation of motion for the sledge decelerated in the sand in the first case:\nma = -mg(x/l)μ,\nwhere m is the mass, a the acceleration, l the length, and μ the coefficient of friction of the sledge against the sand. As in the solution of Problem 1.29, we obtained an \"equation of vibrations\". Therefore, the deceleration of the sledge stuck in the sand corresponds to the motion of a load on a spring (of rigidity k=(mg/l)μ) having acquired the velocity v₀ in the equilibrium position. Then the time dependence x(t) of the part of the sledge stuck in the sand and its velocity v(t) can be written as\nx(t) = x₀ sin(ω₀t), v(t) = v₀ cos(ω₀t),\nwhere x₀ = v₀/ω₀, ω₀ = √((k/m)) = √((g/l)μ).\nIt can easily be seen that the time before the sledge comes to rest is equal to quarter the \"period of vibrations\". Therefore, t₁ = π/(2ω₀) = (π/2)/√(l/(μg)).\nIn the second case (after the jerk), the motion can be regarded as if the sledge stuck in the sand had a velocity v₁ > v₀ and having traversed the distance x₀ were decelerated to the velocity v₀ (starting from this moment, the second case is observed). The motion of the sledge after the jerk can be represented as a part of the total vibratory motion according to the law\nx(t) = x₁ sin(ω₀t), v(t) = v₁ cos(ω₀t)\nstarting from the instant t₂ when the velocity of the sledge becomes equal to v₀. As before, x₁ = v₁/ω₀. Besides,\n(mg/2l)μx₀² = mv₁²/2 - mv₀²/2,\nwhence v₁ = x₀ω₀√2.\nThe distance covered by the sledge after the jerk is\nx₁ - x₀ = (v₁ - v₀)/ω₀ = (1/ω₀)(v₁ - v₀) = x₀(√2 - 1).\nConsequently, the ratio of the braking lengths is (x₁ - x₀)/x₀ = √2 - 1.\nIn order to determine the time of motion of the sledge after the jerk, we must find the time of motion of the sledge from point x₀ to point x₁ by using the formula x(t) = x₁ sin(ω₀t). For this purpose, we determine t₂ from the formula x₀ = x₁ sin(ω₀t₂). Since x₁ = √2x₀, ω₀t₂ = π/4. Consequently, t₂ = π/(4ω₀) = t₁/2. Since t₃ = t₁ - t₂, where t₃ is the time of motion of the sledge after the jerk, we obtain the required ratio of the braking times t₃/t₁ = 1/2."

In order to keep a load of mass m = 6 kg suspended on one end of the rope, the maximum force T₁ = 40 N should be applied to the other end of the rope. Determine the minimum force T₂ which must be applied to the rope to lift the load.",
    "Answers": "The force of gravity mg = 60 N acting on the load is considerably stronger than the force with which the rope should be pulled to keep the load. This is due to considerable friction of the rope against the log.\nAt first, the friction prevents the load from slipping under the action of the force of gravity. The complete analysis of the distribution of friction acting on the rope is rather complex since the tension of the rope at points of its contact with the log varies from T₁ to mg. In turn, the force of pressure exerted by the rope on the log also varies, being proportional at each point to the corresponding local tension of the rope. Accordingly, the friction acting on the rope is determined just by the force of pressure mentioned above. In order to solve the problem, it should be noted, however, that the total friction Fբᵣ (whose components are proportional to the reaction of the log at each point) will be proportional (with the corresponding proportionality factors) to the tensions of the rope at the ends. In particular, for a certain coefficient k, it is equal to the maximum tension: Fբᵣ = kmg. This means that the ratio of the maximum tension to the minimum tension is constant for a given arrangement of the rope and the log: mg/T₁ = 1/(1 - k) since T₁ = mg - kmg.\nWhen we want to lift the load, the ends of the rope as if change places. The friction is now directed against the force T₂ and plays a harmful role. The ratio of the maximum tension (which is now equal to T₂) to the minimum tension (mg) is obviously the same as in the former case: T₂/(mg) = 1/(1 - k) = mg/T₁. Hence we obtain\nT₂ = (mg)²/T₁ = 90 N."

    "Questions": "Why is it more difficult to turn the steering wheel of a stationary motorcar than of a moving car?",
    "Answers": "Let us see what happens when the driver turns the front wheels of a stationary car (we shall consider only one tyre). At the initial moment, the wheel is undeformed (from the point of view of torsion), and the area of the tyre region in contact with the ground is S. By turning the steering wheel, the driver deforms the stationary tyre until the moment of force Mₛ applied to the wheel and tending to turn it becomes larger than the maximum possible moment of static friction acting on the tyre of contact area S. In this case, the forces of friction are perpendicular to the contact plane between the tyre and the ground.\nLet now the motorcar move. Static frictional forces are applied to the same region of the tyre of area S. They almost attain the maximum values and lie in the plane of the tyre. A small moment of force Mₛ' applied to the wheel is sufficient to turn the wheel since it is now counteracted by the total moment of \"oblique\" forces of static friction which is considerably smaller than for the stationary car. In fact, in the case of the moving car, the component of the static friction responsible for the torque preventing the wheel from being turned is similar to liquid friction since stagnation is not observed for turning wheels of a moving car. Thus, a small torque can easily turn a moving wheel, and the higher the velocity (the closer the static friction to the limiting value), the more easily can the wheel be turned."

    "Answers": "Since the motion occurs in the horizontal plane, the vertical component of the force acting on the load is mg, and the horizontal component is given by √[F² - (mg)²] = mg√[α² - 1], where α = 1.25 (Fig. 145). The horizontal acceleration of the load (and the carriage) is determined by this horizontal force: ma=mg√[α² - 1]. Consequently, a = g√[α² - 1] = (3/4)g = 7.5 m/s².\nOn the first segment of the path, the carriage is accelerated to the velocity v = at₁ = (3/4)gt₁ = 30 m/s and covers the distance s₁ in the forward direction in the straight line:\ns₁ = at₁²/2 = (3/8)gt₁² = 60 m.\nFurther, it moves at a constant velocity v during the time interval t₂ = 3 s and traverses the path of length\ns₂ = vt₂ = 90 m.\nThus, seven seconds after the beginning of motion, the carriage is at a distance s₁ + s₂ = 150 m in front of the initial position.\nOn the third segment, the carriage moves round a bend to the right. Since the velocity of the carriage moving on the rails is always directed along the carriage, the constant (during the time interval t₃ = 25.12 s) transverse acceleration a = (3/4)g is a centripetal acceleration, i.e. the carriage moves in a circle at a constant velocity v: a = v²/R, the radius of the circle being R = v²/a = 120 m. The path traversed by the carriage in the circle is s₃ = Rφ = vt₃, whence the angle of rotation of the carriage about the centre of the circle is φ = vt₃/R = 6.28 = 2π rad, i.e. the carriage describes a complete circumference.\nOn the last segment, the carriage brakes and comes to a halt since the acceleration along the carriage is equal to the initial acceleration and acts during the same time interval. Therefore, s₄ = s₁ = 60 m. The carriage stops at a distance s = 2s₁ + s₂ = 210 m in front of the initial position (Fig. 146)."

    "Answers": "Let us first suppose that the air drag is absent.

Then the time of motion of the balls before collision is t = s/(v₂ cos α) ≈ 0.6 s.\nSince the balls are heavy, the role of the air drag can easily be estimated. The nature of motion of the first ball will not change significantly since the acceleration due to the air drag is a_max = 1 m/s² even if the mass of each ball is 10 g, and the maximum velocity of the first ball is v₁ = 10 m/s. This acceleration does not change the total time of motion of the first ball by more than 1%. Since the air drag is directed against the velocity of the ball, we can make the balls collide by imparting the same vertical velocity component to the second ball as that of the first ball provided that in subsequent instants the vertical projections of the accelerations of the balls are identical at any instant of time.

Consequently, the elongation Δl of the string will be such as if it were acted upon by the force mg/2 at the point of suspension and at the lower end, and the string were weightless; hence\nΔl = mg/2k."

    "Answers": "We assume that the condition m₁ + m₂ > m₃ + m₄ is satisfied, otherwise the equilibrium is impossible. The left spring was stretched with the force T₁ balancing the force of gravity m₂g of the load: T₁ = m₂g. The equilibrium condition for the load m₃ was\nm₃g + T₂ - F_ten = 0,\nwhere T₂ is the tension of the right spring, and F_ten is the tension of the rope passed through the pulley (see Fig. 14). This rope holds the loads of mass m₁ and m₃, whence F_ten = (m₁ + m₂)g. We can express the tension T₂ in the following way: T₂ = (m₁ + m₂ - m₃)g.\nAfter cutting the lower thread, the equations of motion for all the loads can be written as follows:\nm₁a₁ = m₁g + T₁ - F_ten, m₂a₂ = m₂g - T₁,\nm₃a₃ = T₂ + m₃g - F_ten, -m₄a₄ = m₄g - T₂.\nUsing the expressions for the forces T₁, T₂, and F_ten obtained above, we find that\na₁ = a₂ = a₃ = 0, a₄ = (m₃ + m₄ - m₁ - m₂)g / m₄."

At the moment when the two loads are at the same height h, the upper pulley is released (is able to rotate without friction like the lower pulley). Indicate the load which touches the floor first after a certain time t, assuming that the person continues to slack the rope at the same constant velocity v. The masses of the pulleys and the ropes and the elongation of the ropes should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "Immediately after releasing the upper pulley, the left load has a velocity v directed upwards, while the right pulley remains at rest. The accelerations of the loads will be as if the free end of the rope were fixed instead of moving at a constant velocity. They can be found from the following equations:\nma₁ = T₁ - mg, ma₂ = T₂ - mg,\n2T₁ = T₂, a₁ = -2a₂,\nwhere m is the mass of each load, and T₁ and T₂ are the tensions of the ropes acting on the left and right loads. Solving the system of equations, we obtain a₁ = -(2/5)g and a₂ = (1/5)g. Thus, the acceleration of the left load is directed downwards, while that of the right load upwards. The time of fall of the left load can be found from the equation\nh - vt - (0.4gt²)/2 = 0,\nwhence t = (2.5v/g) + √((6.25v²)/g² + 5h/g).\nDuring this time, the right load will move upwards.

    "Answers": "If the lower ball is very light, it starts climbing the support. We shall find its minimum mass m₂ for which it has not yet started climbing, but has stopped pressing against the right inclined plane. Since the support is weightless, the horizontal components of the forces of pressure (equal in magnitude to the normal reactions) exerted by the balls on the support must be equal (Fig. 152); otherwise, the “support” would acquire an infinitely large acceleration:\nN₁ sin α = N₂ sin α, N₁ = N₂.\nMoreover, since the lower ball does not ascend, the normal components of the accelerations of the balls relative to the right inclined plane must be equal (there is no relative displacement in this direction). Figure 152 shows that the angle between the direction of the normal reaction N₂ of the support and the right inclined plane is π/2 - 2α, and hence the latter condition can be written in the form\n(m₁g cos α - N₁)/m₁ = (m₂g cos α - N₂ cos 2α)/m₂,\nwhence m₂ = m₁ cos 2α.

The friction between the cylinder and the supports should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "As long as the cylinder is in contact with the supports, the axis of the cylinder will be exactly at the midpoint between the supports. Consequently, the horizontal component of the cylinder velocity is v/2. Since all points of the cylinder axis move in a circle with the centre at point A, the total velocity u of each point on the axis is perpendicular to the radius OA=r at any instant of time. Consequently, all points of the axis move with a centripetal acceleration a_c = u²/r.\nWe shall write the equation of motion for point O in terms of projections on the “centripetal” axis:\nmg cos α - N = ma_c = mu²/r (1),\nwhere N is the normal reaction of the stationary support. The condition that the separation between the supports is r√2 implies that the normal reaction of the movable support gives no contribution to the projections on the “centripetal” axis. According to Newton's third law, the cylinder exerts the force of the same magnitude on the stationary support. From Eq. (1), we obtain N = mg cos α - mu²/r.\nAt the moment when the distance between points A and B of the supports (see Fig. 18) is AB = r√2, we have cos α = (r√2/2)/r = 1/√2. The horizontal component of the velocity of point O is u cos α = v/2, whence u = v√2. Thus, for AB = r√2, the force of normal pressure exerted by the cylinder is\nN = mg/√2 - mv²/2r.\nFor the cylinder to remain in contact with the supports until AB becomes equal to r√2, the condition g/√2 > v²/(2r) must be satisfied, i.e. v < √gr√2."

    "Answers": "The cylinder is acted upon by the force of gravity m₁g, the normal reaction N₁ of the left inclined plane, and the normal reaction N₃ of the wedge (force N₃ has the horizontal direction). We shall write the equation of motion of the cylinder in terms of projections on the x₁-axis directed along the left inclined plane (Fig. 153):\nm₁a₁ = m₁g sin α - N₃ cos α, (1)\nwhere a₁ is the projection of the acceleration of the cylinder on the x₁ axis.\nThe wedge is acted upon by the force of gravity m₂g, the normal reaction N₂ of the right inclined plane, and the normal reaction of the cylinder, which, according to Newton's third law, is equal to -N₃.

What will be the velocity u of the body at this moment? Friction should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "As long as the load touches the body, the velocity of the latter is equal to the horizontal component of the velocity of the load, and the acceleration of the body is equal to the horizontal component of the acceleration of the load. Let a be the total acceleration of the load. Then we can write a = a_t + a_c, where a_c is the centripetal acceleration of the load moving in the circle of radius l, i.e. a_c = v²/l, where v is the velocity of the load (Fig. 154). The horizontal component of the acceleration is\na_h = a_t sin α - (v²/l)cos α.\nThe body also has the same acceleration. We can write the equation of motion for the body:\nN = Ma_h = Ma_t sin α - M(v²/l)cos α,\nwhere N is the force of normal pressure exerted by the load on the body. At the moment of separation of the load, N = 0 and a_t sin α = (v²/l)cos α.\nThe acceleration component a_t at the moment of separation of the load is only due to the force of gravity: a_t = g cos α. Thus, the velocity of the load at the moment of separation is v = √(gl sin α), and the velocity of the body at the same moment is u = v sin α = sin α √(gl sin α).\nAccording to the energy conservation law, we have\nmgl = mgl sin α + mv²/2 + Mv²sin²α/2.\nSubstituting the obtained expression for v at the moment of separation and the value of sin α = sin π/6 = 1/2 into this equation, we obtain the ratio:\nM/m = (2-3sinα)/sin³α = 4.\nThe velocity of the body at the moment of separation is u = v sin α = (1/2)√(gl/2)."

    "Answers": "The rod is under the action of three forces: the tension T of the string, the force of gravity mg, and the reaction of the wall R = N + F_fr (N is the normal reaction of the wall, and F_fr is friction, F_fr ≤ μN). When the rod is in equilibrium, the sum of the moments of these forces about any point is zero. For this condition to be satisfied, the line of action of the force R must pass through the point of intersection of the lines of action of T and mg (the moments of the forces T and mg about this point are zero).\nDepending on the relation between the angles α and β, the point of intersection of the lines of action of T and mg may lie (1) above the perpendicular AM₀ to the wall (point M₁ in Fig. 155); (2) below this perpendicular (point M₂); (3) on the perpendicular (point M₀). Accordingly, the friction is either directed upwards along AC (F_fr1), or downwards along AC (F_fr2), or is equal to zero.

From Eqs.

What moment of force M must be applied to the axis of the larger disc to maintain its velocity of rotation constant? The radius of the larger disc is R > d + r. The friction at the axes of the discs should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "Let us analyze the motion of the smaller disc immediately after it comes in contact with the larger disc. We choose two equal small regions of the smaller disc lying on the same diameter symmetrically about the centre O' of this disc. In Fig. 56, points A₁ and A₂ are the centres of mass of these regions. At the moment of contact (when the smaller disc is still at rest), the velocities v₁ and v₂ of the points of the larger disc which are in contact with points A₁ and A₂ of the smaller disc are directed as shown in Fig. 56 (v₁ = Ω·OA₁ and v₂ = Ω·OA₂). The forces of friction F_fr1 and F_fr2 exerted by the larger disc on the centres of mass A₁ and A₂ of the selected regions of the smaller disc will obviously be directed at the moment of contact along the velocities v₁ and v₂ (F_fr1 = F_fr2). Since the arm l₁ of the force F_fr1 about the axis of the smaller disc is smaller than the arm l₂ of the force F_fr2 (see Fig. 56), the total torque of the couple F_fr1 and F_fr2 will rotate the smaller disc in the direction of rotation of the larger disc.\nHaving considered similar pairs of regions of the smaller disc, we arrive at the conclusion that immediately after coming in contact, the smaller disc will be rotated in the direction of rotation of the larger disc. Let the angular velocity of the smaller disc at a certain moment of time become ω. The velocities of the regions with the centres of mass at points A₁ and A₂ will be v'₁ = v'₂ = ωr, where r = O'A₁ = O'A₂ (Fig. 157). The forces of friction F'_fr1 and F'_fr2 acting on these regions will be directed along vectors v₁-v'₁ (the relative velocity of the point of the larger disc touching point A₁) and v₂ - v'₂ (the relative velocity of the point of the larger disc touching point A₂). Obviously, the torque of the couple F'_fr1 and F'_fr2 will accelerate the smaller disc (i.e. the angular velocity of the disc will vary) if v'₁ = v'₂ < B₁B₂/2 = Ωr (see Fig. 157; for the sake of convenience, the vectors “pertaining” to point A₂ are translated to point A₁). Thus, as long as ω < Ω, there exists a nonzero frictional torque which sets the smaller disc into rotation. When ω = Ω, the relative velocities of the regions with the centres of mass at points A₁ and A₂ are perpendicular to the segment OO' (directed along the segment A₁C in Fig. 157), and the frictional torque about the axis of the smaller disc is zero. Consequently, the smaller disc will rotate at the steady-state angular velocity Ω.\nFor ω = Ω, all the forces of friction acting on similar pairs of regions of the smaller disc will be equal in magnitude and have the same direction, viz. perpendicular to the segment OO'. According to Newton's third law, the resultant of all the forces of friction acting on the larger disc will be applied at the point of the larger disc touching the centre O' of the smaller disc and will be equal to μmg. In order to balance the decelerating torque of this force, the moment of force M = μmgd must be applied to the axis of the larger disc."

Since each force of pressure is proportional to the mass (N₁ = m₁g and N₂ = m₂g), the ratio of the forces of friction can be written in the form\nF_fr1/F_fr2 = m₁/m₂ (1).\nOn the other hand, from the equality of the moments of these forces about the vertex of the right angle (Fig. 158, top view), we obtain\nlF_fr1 cos φ = lF_fr2 sin φ, (2)\nwhere l is the distance from the vertex to the centres of mass of the rods.

Let t₀ be the time of free fall of the body from the height h. Then the time in which the body falls without a bullet is t₁ = t₀/√2. At the moment the bullet of mass M hits the body of mass m, the momentum of the body is directed vertically downwards and is\nmv = mgt₀/√2.\nThe horizontally flying bullet hitting the body will not change the vertical component of the momentum of the formed system, and hence the vertical component of the velocity of the body-bullet system will be\nu = m/(m+M)v = m/(m+M)g(t₀/√2).\nThe time t₂ required for the body-bullet system to traverse the remaining half the distance can be determined from the equation\nh/2 = ut₂ + gt₂²/2.\nThis gives\nt = (t₀/√2)(√(m²+(m+M)²)-m)/(m+M).\nThus, the total time of fall of the body to the ground (M ≫ m) will be\nt = (t₀/√2)(√(m²+(m+M)²)+M)/(m+M) ≈ t₀√2."

It can easily be seen that the motion of the washer will be repeated with period 2Δt, where Δt = (D-2r)/v is the time of flight of the washer between two successive collisions with the box (every time the centre of the washer covers a distance D-2r at a velocity v).\nReturning to the reference frame fixed to the ground, we can plot the time dependence v_wash(t) of the velocity of the centre of the washer. Knowing the velocity graph v_wash(t), we can easily plot the time dependence of the displacement x_wash(t) of the centre of the washer (Fig. 162)."

A small washer of mass m with zero initial velocity slides from the upper point of the hoop along a smooth groove in the inner surface of the hoop. Determine the velocity u of the centre of the hoop at the moment when the washer is at a certain point A of the hoop, whose radius vector forms an angle φ with the vertical (Fig. 28). The friction between the hoop and the plane should be neglected.",
    "Answers": "The forces acting on the hoop-washer system are the force of gravity and the normal reaction of the plane. These forces are directed along the vertical. Consequently, the centre of mass of the system does not move in the horizontal direction. Since there is no friction between the hoop and the plane, the motion of the hoop is translatory. According to the momentum conservation law, at any instant of time we have\nMu + mvₓ = 0, (1)\nwhere u and vₓ are the horizontal components of the velocities of the centre of the hoop and the washer. Since vₓ periodically changes its sign, u also changes sign “synchronously”. The general nature of motion of the hoop is as follows: the centre of the hoop moves to the right when the washer is on segments BC and BE, and to the left when the washer is on segments CD and DE (Fig. 163).\nThe velocities v of the washer and u of the hoop are connected through the energy conservation law:\nmgr(1+cosφ) = mv²/2 + Mu²/2. (2)\nThe motion of the washer relative to a stationary observer can be represented at any instant as the superposition of two motions: the motion relative to the centre of the hoop at a velocity vₜ directed along the tangent to the hoop, and the motion together with the hoop at its velocity u having the horizontal direction (Fig. 164). The figure shows that\nvᵧ/(vₓ+vᵧ) = tan φ. (3)\nSolving Eqs. (1)-(3) together, we determine the velocity of the centre of the hoop at the instant when the radius vector of the point of location of the washer forms an angle φ with the vertical:\nu = m cos φ √((2gr(1+cosφ))/((M+m)(M+m sin φ)))."

Determine the tension T of the left string at the instant when the right string snaps.",
    "Answers": "At the moment of snapping of the right string, the rod is acted upon by the tension T of the left string and the forces N₁ and N₂ of normal pressure of the loads of mass m₁ and m₂ (Fig. 165). Since the rod is weightless (its mass is zero), the equations of its translatory and rotary motions will have the form\n-T + N₁ - N₂ = 0, N₁l = 2N₂l.\nThe second equation (the condition of equality to zero of the sum of all moments of force about point O) implies that\nN₁ = 2N₂. (1)\nCombining these conditions, we get (see Fig. 165)\nT = N₁ - N₂ = N₂. (2)\nAt the moment of snapping of the right string, the accelerations of the loads of mass m₁ and m₂ will be vertical (point O is stationary, and the rod is inextensible) and connected through the relation\na₂ = 2a₁.

Since N'₁ = N₁ and N'₂ = N₂, we have\nm₁g - 2N₂ = m₁a₁, m₂g + N₂ = 2m₂a₁.\nHence we can find N₂, and consequently (see Eq. (2)) the tension of the string\nT = N₂ = (m₁m₂g) / (m₁ + 4m₂)."

The velocity of translatory motion of the hoops at this moment must be equal to u = v tan α (Δt is so small that the angle α practically remains unchanged). Consequently, the linear velocity of all points of the hoops must have the same magnitude.

Since Δt is small, we can assume that v² = 2aΔl, (1) where a is the acceleration of all points of the rope at the initial instant.\nFrom the energy conservation law (friction is absent), it follows that Mv²/2 = ΔWₚ, (2) where M is the mass of the rope, and ΔWₚ is the change in the potential energy of the rope during the time interval Δt. Obviously, ΔWₚ corresponds to the redistribution of the mass of the rope, as a result of which a piece of the rope of length Δl “passes” from point A to point B (see Fig. 31).

The mass of each block is equal to the mass of the washer. The diameter of the washer and its height are equal to the edge of the block. Determine the velocities of all the bodies after the impact.",
    "Answers": "It is clear that at the moment of impact, only the extreme blocks come in contact with the washer. The force acting on each such block is perpendicular to the contact surface between the washer and a block and passes through its centre (the diameter of the washer is equal to the edge of the block!). Therefore, the middle block remains at rest as a result of the impact. For the extreme blocks and the washer, we can write the conservation law for the momentum in the direction of the velocity v of the washer:\nmv = 2mu√2/2 + mv'.\nHere m is the mass of each block and the washer, v' is the velocity of the washer after the impact, and u is the velocity of each extreme block. The energy conservation law implies that\nv² = 2u² + v'².\nAs a result, we find that u = v√2 and v' = 0. Consequently, the velocities of the extreme blocks after the impact form the angles of 45° with the velocity v, the washer stops, and the middle block remains at rest."

As a result of explosion, the momentum component of the ball along the pipe remains equal to zero since there is no friction, and the reaction forces are directed at right angles to the velocities of the fragments.

At what initial arrangement of the bodies will the amount of liberated heat be maximum? Assume that collisions are perfectly inelastic.",
    "Answers": "For the liberated amount of heat to be maximum, the following conditions must be satisfied: (1) the potential energy of the bodies must be maximum at the initial moment; (2) the bodies must collide simultaneously at the lowest point of the cup; (3) the velocity of the bodies must be zero immediately after the collision.\nIf these conditions are satisfied, the whole of the initial potential energy of the bodies will be transformed into heat. Consequently, at the initial instant the bodies must be arranged on the brim of the cup at a height r above the lowest point. The arrangement of the bodies must be such that their total momentum before the collision is zero (in this case, the body formed as a result of collision from the bodies stuck together will remain at rest at the bottom of the cup).

The process of their elastic collision is described by the momentum conservation law\n4mv₀ = 4mv₂ + mv₁,\nand by the energy conservation law\n4mv₀²/2 = mv₁²/2 + 4mv₂²/2,\nwhere v₁ and v₂ are the velocities of the proton and the α-particle in the stationary reference frame after the collision, and m and 4m are the masses of the proton and the α-particle respectively.\nLet us consider the collision of these particles in the centre-of-mass system, i.e. in an inertial reference frame moving relative to the stationary reference frame at a velocity\nv' = 4mv₀/(m+4m) = (4/5)v₀\n(the numerator of the first fraction contains the total momentum of the system, and the denominator contains its total mass). Figure 168 shows the velocity v₀ and the velocities of the α-particle (vector OB) and the proton (vector OA) in the centre-of-mass system before the collision: OB = (1/5)v₀ and OA = (4/5)v₀. According to the momentum conservation law, after the collision, the velocity vectors OB' and OA' of the α-particle and the proton must lie on the same straight line, and the relation OB':OA' = 1:4 (see Fig. 168) must be satisfied. According to the energy conservation law, OB' = OB and OA' = OA (prove this!).\nIn the stationary reference frame, the velocities of the α-particle and the proton are represented in the figure by vectors OC₂ = OB' + v' and OC₁ = OA' + v'. In order to solve the problem, we must determine the maximum possible length of vector OC₁, i.e. in the isosceles triangle OA'C₁, we must determine the maximum possible length of the base for constant values of the lateral sides.

A small body at point A is pushed upwards along the inner surface of the pipe so that the direction of its initial velocity forms an angle φ with generatrix AB. Determine the minimum initial velocity v₀ at which the body starts moving upwards without being separated from the surface of the pipe.",
    "Answers": "At any instant of time, the complex motion of the body in the pipe can be represented as the superposition of two independent motions: the motion along the axis of the pipe and the motion in the circle in a plane perpendicular to the pipe axis (Fig. 169). The separation of the body from the pipe surface will affect only the latter motion (the body will not move in a circle). Therefore, we shall consider only this motion.\nThe body moving in a circle experiences the action of the normal reaction N of the pipe walls (vector N lies in the plane perpendicular to the pipe axis) and the “force of gravity” mg' = mg cos α. We shall write the condition of motion for the body in a circle:\nmg' cos β + N = mv²/r, (1)\nwhere β is the angle formed by the radius vector of the point of location of the body at a given instant and the “vertical” y' (Fig. 170). For the body to remain in contact with the surface of the pipe the condition N = mv²/r - mg' cos β ≥ 0 must be fulfilled, whence\nv² ≥ g'r cos β. (2)\nThe relation between the velocity v at which the body moves in a circle at a given instant and the initial velocity v₀ can be obtained from the energy conservation law: for any value of the angle β, the following relation must hold:\nmv²/2 + mg'r cos β = m(v₀ sin φ)²/2 + mg'r,\nwhence v² = v₀²sin²φ + 2g'r - 2g'r cos β. (3)\nSubstituting Eq. (3) into Eq. (2), we obtain the values of v₀ for which the body remains in contact with the pipe:\nv₀² ≥ (3g'r cos β - 2g'r) / sin²φ.\nSince this condition must be satisfied for any value of β ∈ [0, 2π], we finally obtain\nv₀² ≥ g'r/sin²φ = (gr cos α)/sin²φ."

Determine the average tension T of the rope at which the wheel moves at a constant velocity v, assuming the mass of the wheel to be concentrated at its axle.",
    "Answers": "Let us suppose that at a certain instant, the wheel is in one of the positions such that its centre of mass is above a rod, and its velocity is v. At the moment of the impact against the next rod (Fig. 171), the centre of mass of the wheel has a certain velocity v' perpendicular to the line connecting it to the previous rod. This velocity can be obtained from the energy conservation law:\nmgh + mv²/2 = mv'²/2.\nHere h = r - √(r² - l²/4) ≈ l²/(8r). Therefore,\nv' = v√(1 + gl²/(4rv²)).\nBy hypothesis (the motion is without jumps), the impact of the wheel against the rod is perfectly inelastic. This means that during the impact, the projection of the momentum of the wheel on the straight line connecting the centre of the wheel to the rod vanishes. Thus, during each collision, the energy\nΔW = m(v'sinα)²/2,\nwhere sinα ≈ l/r, is lost (converted into heat). For the velocity v to remain constant, the work done by the tension T of the rope over the path l must compensate for this energy loss. Therefore,\nTl = (mv²/2)(1 + gl²/(4rv²))(l²/r²),\nwhence T = (mv²l/2r²)(1 + gl²/(4rv²)) ≈ mv²l/2r²."

    "Answers": "Since the wheels move without slipping, the axle of the coupled wheels rotates about point O while passing through the boundary between the planes (Fig. 172).

The total energy of the system in the final state will also be a purely potential energy equal to the initial energy in view of the absence of friction. The final energy is the sum of the energy mgr of the rim and the energy of the ribbon wound on it. The centre of mass of the latter will be assumed to coincide with the centre of mass of the rim. This assumption is justified if the length of the wound ribbon is much larger than the length of the circumference of the rim. Then the potential energy of the wound ribbon is\nρ(h/sinα + s)gr,\nthe length of the ribbon being h/sinα + s, where s is the required distance traversed by the rim from the foot of the inclined plane to the point at which it comes to rest.

    "Questions": "A conveyer belt having a length l and carrying a block of mass m moves at a velocity v (Fig. 41). Determine the velocity v₀ with which the block should be pushed against the direction of motion of the conveyer so that the amount of heat liberated as a result of deceleration of the block by the conveyer belt is maximum. What is the maximum amount of heat Q if the coefficient of friction is μ and the condition v < √2μlg is satisfied?",
    "Answers": "The amount of liberated heat will be maximum if the block traverses the maximum distance relative to the conveyer belt. For this purpose, it is required that the velocity of the block relative to the ground in the vicinity of the roller A must be zero (see Fig. 41). The initial velocity of the block relative to the ground is determined from the conditions\n-v₀ + at = 0, l = v₀t - at²/2,\nwhere a = μg is the acceleration imparted to the block by friction. Hence\nv₀ = √2μgl.\nThe time of motion of the block along the conveyer belt to the roller A is t = √(2l/μg).\nThe distance covered by the block before it stops is s₁ = l + vt = l + v√(2l/μg).\nThen the block starts moving with a constant acceleration to the right. The time interval in which the slippage ceases is τ = v/a = v/μg. The distance by which the block is displaced relative to the ground during this time is s = aτ²/2 = v²/2μg.\nSince v < √2μgl by hypothesis, the block does not slip from the conveyer belt during this time, i.e. s < l.\nThe distance covered by the block relative to the conveyer belt during this time is s₂ = |v²/2a - vτ| = v²/2μg.\nThe total distance traversed by the block relative to the conveyer belt is\ns = s₁ + s₂ = l + v√(2l/μg) + v²/2μg = (v + √2μgl)²/2μg.\nThe amount of heat liberated at the expense of the work done by friction is\nQ = μmgs = m(v + √2μgl)²/2."

In the former case, the pipe rolls down without slipping, while in the latter case, it slips on a certain region. In what case will the velocity of the pipe at the end of the path be lower?",
    "Answers": "In the former case (the motion of the pipe without slipping), the initial amount of potential energy stored in the gravitational field will be transformed into the kinetic energy of the pipe, which will be equally distributed between the energies of rotary and translatory motion. In the latter case (the motion with slipping), not all the potential energy will be converted into the kinetic energy at the end of the path because of the work done against friction. Since in this case the energy will also be equally distributed between the energies of translatory and rotary motions, the velocity of the pipe at the end of the path will be smaller in the latter case."

    "Questions": "A heavy load is suspended on a light spring. The spring is slowly pulled down at the midpoint (a certain work A is done thereby) and then released. Determine the maximum kinetic energy Wₖ of the load in the subsequent motion.",
    "Answers": "After the spring has been released, it is uniformly stretched. In the process, very fast vibrations of the spring emerge, which also attenuate very soon. During this time, the load cannot be noticeably displaced, i.e. if the middle of the spring has been displaced by a distance x in doing the work A, the entire spring is now stretched by x. Therefore, the potential energy of the spring, which is equal to the maximum kinetic energy in the subsequent vibratory motion, is Wₖ = kx²/2, where k is the rigidity of the entire spring. When the spring is pulled downwards at the midpoint, only its upper half (whose rigidity is 2k) is stretched, and the work equal to the potential energy of extension of the upper part of the spring is A = 2k(x²/2) = kx². Hence we may conclude that the maximum kinetic energy of the load in the subsequent motion is Wₖ = A/2."

Before the collision, the station moved around a planet in a circular orbit of radius R. Therefore, the velocity v₁ of the station can be found from the equation\n10mv₁²/R = G(10mM)/R², hence v₁ = √GM/R.\nIn accordance with the momentum conservation law, the velocities u, v₁, and v₂ are connected through the following relation: mu + 10mv₁ = 11mv₂.\nWe shall write the momentum conservation law in projections on the x- and y-axes (Fig. 179):\n10mv₁ = 11mv₂ₓ, (1)\nmu = 11mv₂ᵧ.

    "Answers": "Let us consider the equilibrium conditions for the rod at the instant when it forms an angle α with the horizontal. The forces acting on the rod are shown in Fig. 181. While solving this problem, it is convenient to make use of the equality to zero of the sum of the torques about the point of intersection of the force of gravity mg and the force F applied by the person perpendicular to the rod (point O) since the moments of these forces about this point are zero.\nIf the length of the rod is 2l, the arm of the normal reaction N is l cos α, while the arm of the friction is l/sin α + l sin α, and the equilibrium condition will be written in the form\nNl cos α = F_fr(l/sin α + l sin α) = F_fr l(1+sin²α)/sin α,\nwhence\nF_fr = N(cos α sin α)/(1+sin²α) = N(cos α sin α)/(2sin²α+cos²α) = N * 1/(2tanα+cotα).\nOn the other hand, the friction cannot exceed the sliding friction μN, and hence\nμ ≥ 1/(2tanα+cotα).\nThis inequality must be fulfilled at all values of the angle α. Consequently, in order to find the minimum coefficient of friction μ_min, we must find the maximum of the function (2x²+1/x²)^-1, where x²=tanα. The identity 2x²+1/x² = (√2x-1/x)² + 2√2 implies that the maximum value of 1/(2tanα+cotα) is 1/(2√2) = √2/4 and is attained at x² = tanα = 1/√2.

The same pencil placed parallel to the generatrix rolls down the plane. Determine the angle φ between the axis of the pencil and the generatrix of the inclined plane (Fig. 46) at which the pencil is still in equilibrium.",
    "Answers": "By hypothesis, the coefficient of sliding friction between the pencil and the inclined plane satisfies the condition μ ≥ tan α. Indeed, the pencil put at right angles to the generatrix is in equilibrium, which means that mg sin α = F_fr, where mg is the force of gravity, and F_fr is the force of friction. But F_fr ≤ μmg cos α. Consequently, mg sin α ≤ μmg cos α, whence μ ≥ tan α. Thus, the pencil will not slide down the inclined plane for any value of the angle φ.\nThe pencil may start rolling down at an angle φ₀ such that the vector of the force of gravity “leaves” the region of contact between the pencil and the inclined plane (hatched region in Fig. 183). In order to find this angle, we project the centre of mass of the pencil (point A) on the inclined plane and mark the point of intersection of the vertical passing through the centre of mass and the inclined plane (point B). Obviously, points A and B will be at rest for different orientations of the pencil if its centre of mass remains stationary. In this case, AB = 2l cos 30° tan α, where 2l is the side of a hexagonal cross section of the pencil, and 2l cos 30° is the radius of the circle inscribed in the hexagonal cross section. As long as point B lies in the hatched region, the pencil will not roll down the plane. Let us write the condition for the beginning of rolling down\nAD/cos φ₀ = AB, or l/cos φ₀ = l√3 tan α,\nwhence\nφ₀ = arccos(1/(√3 tan α)).\nThus, if the angle φ satisfies the condition\narccos(1/(√3 tan α)) ≤ φ ≤ π/2,\nthe pencil remains in equilibrium. The expression for the angle φ₀ is meaningful provided that tan α > 1/√3. The fact that the pencil put parallel to the generatrix rolls down indicates that tan α > 1/√3 (prove this!)."

Assuming that the time of collision of the ball with the surface is small in comparison with the time interval Δt between two consecutive collisions, we obtain\nΔt = 2√(2h/g).\nAs a result of each collision, the momentum of the ball changes by Δp = 2mv = 2m√(2gh). Therefore, the same momentum Δp = 2m√(2gh) is transferred to the horizontal surface in one collision. In order to determine the mean force exerted by the ball on the horizontal surface we consider the time interval τ > Δt. The momentum transferred to the horizontal surface during the time τ is\nΔP = (τ/Δt)Δp = (τ/2√(2h/g))2m√(2gh) = mgt.\nConsequently, the force exerted by the jumping ball on the horizontal surface and averaged during the time interval τ can be obtained from the relation\nF_m = ΔP/τ = mg.\nBy hypothesis, the mass M of the pan of the balance is much larger than the mass m of the ball.

Indeed, if EF ⊥ DK, FK = 2r tan α ≈ 2rα. But BD ≈ FK/2 ≈ rα.

Therefore, the total kinetic energy of the hoop is mv² (m is its mass, and v is the velocity of the centre of mass). According to the energy conservation law, mv² = mg(r-hₐ), where hₐ is the height of the centre of mass of the hoop above point A at each instant of time. Consequently, the velocity of the centre of mass of the hoop is v = √g(r-hₐ). On the other hand, the velocity of the pendulum B at the moment when it is at a height hₐ above the rotational axis A is v = √2g(r-hₐ), i.e. is √2 times larger.

Thus, the required period of small oscillations of the system is\nT = 2π√(l'/g') = 2π√(l/g) = 2π√(2l/g)."

The lengths l₁ and l₂ of the ropes are such that l₁² + l₂² = a² + b² (Fig. 52). Determine the period T of small oscillations of the swing, neglecting the height of the swinging person in comparison with the above lengths.",
    "Answers": "In order to solve the problem, it is sufficient to note that the motion of the swing is a rotation about an axis passing through the points where the ropes are fixed, i.e. the system is a “tilted simple pendulum” (Fig. 190). The component of the force of gravity mg along the rotational axis does not influence the oscillations, while the normal component mg sin α is in fact the restoring force. Therefore, using the formula for the period of a simple pendulum, we can write\nT = 2π√(h/gsinα),\nwhere h = l₁l₂/√(l₁²+l₂²) = l₁l₂/√(a²+b²),\nsin α = a/√(a²+b²).\nConsequently, the period of small oscillations of the swing is\nT = 2π√(l₁l₂/ag)."

    "Questions": "Being a punctual man, the lift operator of a skyscraper hung an exact pendulum clock on the lift wall to know the end of the working day. The lift moves with an upward and downward accelerations during the same time (according to a stationary clock), the magnitudes of the accelerations remaining unchanged. Will the operator finish his working day in time, or will he work more (less) than required?",
    "Answers": "The period of a simple pendulum is inversely proportional to the square root of the free-fall acceleration:\nT ∝ 1/√g.\nLet the magnitude of the acceleration of the lift be a. Then the period of the pendulum for the lift moving upwards with an acceleration a will be\nT_up ∝ 1/√(g+a)\nand for the lift moving downwards with the same acceleration\nT_down ∝ 1/√(g-a).\nObviously, the time measured by the pendulum clock moving upwards with the acceleration a is proportional to the ratio of the time t_up of the upward uniformly accelerated motion to the period T_up:\nt'_up = t_up/T_up ∝ t_up√(g+a).\nThe time measured by the pendulum clock moving downwards with the acceleration a is\nt'_down = t_down/T_down ∝ t_down√(g-a).\nBy hypothesis, the times of the uniformly accelerated downward and upward motions are equal: t_down = t_up = t₁/2, where t₁ is the total time of accelerated motion of the lift. Therefore, the time measured by the pendulum clock during a working day is\nt' ≈ (t₁/2)(√(g+a)/√g + √(g-a)/√g) + t₀.\nHere t₀ is the time of the uniform motion of the lift. The stationary pendulum clock would indicate t ≈ t₁ + t₀. It can easily be seen that the inequality √(g+a) + √(g-a) < 2√g is fulfilled. Indeed,\n(√(g+a) + √(g-a))² / (2√g)² = (2g + 2√(g²-a²))/(4g) = (g + √(g²-a²))/(2g) < 1.\nHence it follows that on the average the pendulum clock in the lift lags behind: t' < t, and hence the operator works too much."

Therefore, at the upper storeys of the Moscow State University building the atmospheric pressure must be lower than at the lower storeys. In order to verify this, a student connected one arm of a U-shaped manometer to the upper auditorium and the other arm to the lower auditorium. What will the manometer indicate?",
    "Answers": "Pascal's law implies that the pressure of a gas in communicating vessels is the same at the same altitude. Since the tubes of the manometer communicate with the atmosphere, the pressure in them varies with altitude according to the same law as the atmospheric air pressure. This means that the pressure exerted by the air on the liquid in different arms of the manometer is the same and equal to the atmospheric pressure at the altitude of the manometer. Thus, the reading of the manometer corresponds to the zero level since there is no pressure difference."

The pressure of mercury vapour and the forces of adhesion between the material of the tubes and mercury should be neglected.",

Then the potential energy of mercury at the initial instant of time is\nWᵢ = 2Slρ_merg(l/2) = ρ_mergSl².\nThe potential energy of mercury at the final instant (the moment of separation of the inner tube, Fig. 191) is (by hypothesis, l > h)\nW_f = 2Sxρ_merg(x/2) + Shρ_merg(x+h/2),\nwhere x is the level of mercury in the outer tube at the moment of separation. This level can be found from the condition of the constancy of the mercury volume:\n2Sx + Sh = 2Sl, x = l - h/2.\nThe difference in the potential energies is equal to the sum of the required work A done by external forces and the work done by the force of atmospheric pressure acting on the surface of mercury in the outer tube and on the upper (sealed) end of the inner tube. The displacement of mercury in the outer tube is l-x, the corresponding work of the force of atmospheric pressure being p₀S(l-x) = ρ_mergSh(l-x). The displacement of the sealed end of the inner tube is l - (l+x), the corresponding work being -p₀Sx = -ρ_mergShx.\nTherefore, the required work of external forces is\nA = W_f - Wᵢ - ρ_mergSh(l-2x) = ρ_mergSh(l-3h/4)."

    "Questions": "Two cylinders with a horizontal and a vertical axis respectively rest on a horizontal surface. The cylinders are connected at the lower parts through a thin tube. The “horizontal” cylinder of radius r is open at one end and has a piston in it (Fig. 53). The “vertical” cylinder is open at the top. The cylinders contain water which completely fills the part of the horizontal cylinder behind the piston and is at a certain level in the vertical cylinder. Determine the level h of water in the vertical cylinder at which the piston is in equilibrium, neglecting friction.",
    "Answers": "The pressure at the bottom of the “vertical” cylinder is p = p₀ + ρ_wgh, where p₀ is the atmospheric pressure, ρ_w is the density of water, and g is the free-fall acceleration. According to Pascal's law, the same pressure is exerted on the lower part of the piston in the “horizontal” cylinder. The total pressure of water on the part of the piston separated from the lower part by a distance x along the vertical is p - ρ_wgx (Fig. 192).\nLet us consider the parts of the piston in the form of narrow (of width Δx) horizontal strips separated by equal distances a from its centre. The force of pressure exerted by water on the upper strip is [p - ρ_wg(r+a)]ΔS, while the force of pressure on the lower strip is [p - ρ_wg(r-a)]ΔS, where ΔS is the area of a strip. The sum of these forces is proportional to the area of the strip, the proportionality factor 2(p-ρ_wgr) being independent of a. Hence it follows that the total force of pressure of water on the piston is (p - ρ_wgr)πr² = [p₀ + ρ_wg(h-r)]πr².\nThe piston is in equilibrium when this force is equal to the force of atmospheric pressure acting on the piston from the left and equal to p₀πr². Hence h=r, i.e. the piston is in equilibrium when the level of water in the vertical cylinder is equal to the radius of the horizontal cylinder. An analysis of the solution shows that this equilibrium is stable."

By hypothesis, we can state that the sphere is completely submerged in water (otherwise, nearly the whole chain would hang, which is impossible in view of the large density of iron). Then the height h can be obtained from the equality of the total force of gravity of the sphere and the hanging part of the chain and the buoyant force acting on them:\n(M + m(h-D/2)/l)g = ρ_w(V + m(h-D/2)/l * 1/ρ_iron)g.\nHence\nh = D/2 + (ρ_wV - M)/(m(1 - ρ_w/ρ_iron))l = 1.6 m.\nThe depth at which the sphere floats is H-h = 1.4 m."

    "Answers": "Let the volume of the steel ball be V, and let the volume of its part immersed in mercury be V₀ before water is poured and V₁ after water covers the ball completely. The value of V₀ can be found from the condition\nρ_stV = ρ_merV₀,\nwhere ρ_st and ρ_mer are the densities of steel and mercury. Since the pressure of water is transmitted through mercury to the lower part of the ball, the buoyant force exerted on it by water is ρ_w(V-V₁)g, where ρ_w is the density of water, while the buoyancy of mercury is ρ_merV₁g. The condition of floating for the ball now becomes\nρ_stV = ρ_merV₁ + ρ_w(V-V₁),\nwhence V₁ = (ρ_st - ρ_w)/(ρ_mer - ρ_w)V.\nThus, the ratio of the volumes of the parts of the ball submerged in mercury in the former and latter cases is\nV₀/V₁ = (ρ_st/ρ_mer) * (ρ_mer - ρ_w)/(ρ_st - ρ_w) = (1 - ρ_w/ρ_mer)/(1 - ρ_w/ρ_st).\nSince ρ_mer > ρ_st, V₀ > V₁, i.e. the volume of the part of the ball immersed in mercury will become smaller when water is poured."

If the vessel contained only water, its level h₁ for the same position of the piece of ice relative to the bottom of the vessel would obey the condition h₀ < h₁ < h.\nWater formed as a result of melting ice has a volume corresponding to the hatched region in the figure.
