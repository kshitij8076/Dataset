    "Answers": "3.1. Due to polarization of the insulator rod AB, the point charge +q₁ will be acted upon, in addition to the point charge -q₂, by the polarization charges formed at the ends of the rod (Fig. 206).\n[Image of Fig. 206]\nThe attractive force exerted by the negative charge induced at the end A will be stronger than the repulsive force exerted by the positive charge induced at the end B.

    "Answers": "3.2. In the immediate proximity of each of point charges, the contribution from the other charge to the total field strength is negligibly small, and hence the electric field lines emerge from (enter) the charge in a spatially homogeneous bundle, their total number being proportional to the magnitude of the charge. Only a fraction of these lines gets into a cone with an angle 2α at the vertex near the charge +q₁. The ratio of the number of these lines to the total number of the lines emerging from the charge +q₁ is equal to the ratio of the areas of the corresponding spherical segments:\n(2πRR(1 - cos α)) / (4πR²) = 1/2 (1 - cos α).\nSince the electric field lines connect the two charges of equal magnitude, the number of lines emerging from the charge +q₁ within the angle 2α is equal to the number of lines entering the charge -q₂ at an angle 2β. Consequently,\n|q₁|(1 - cos α) = |q₂|(1 - cos β),\nwhence\nsin(β/2) = sin(α/2) * √(|q₁|/|q₂|).\nIf √(|q₁|/|q₂|) sin(α/2) > 1, an electric field line will not enter the charge -q₂."

    "Questions": "Determine the strength E of the electric field at the centre of a hemisphere produced by charges uniformly distributed with a density σ over the surface of this hemisphere.",
    "Answers": "3.3. Before solving this problem, let us formulate the theorem which will be useful for solving this and more complicated problems. Below we shall give the proof of this theorem applicable to the specific case considered in Problem 3.3.\nIf a charge is distributed with a constant density σ over a part of the spherical surface of radius R, the projection of the electric field strength due to this charge at the centre of the spherical surface on an arbitrary direction a is\nEₐ = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (σ / R²) * S⟂ₐ,\nwhere S⟂ₐ is the area of the projection of the part of the surface on the plane perpendicular to the direction a.\nLet us consider a certain region of the spherical surface (\"lobule\") and orient it as shown in Fig. 207, i.e. make the symmetry plane of the lobule coincide with the z- and x-axes. From the symmetry of charge distribution it follows that the total field strength at the origin of the coordinate system (point O) will be directed against the z-axis (if σ > 0), and the field strength components along the x- and y-axes will be zero.\nLet us consider a small region of the surface ΔS of the lobule. The vertical component of the electric field strength at point O produced by the surface element ΔS is given by\nΔE = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (σ / R²) * ΔS cos φ,\nwhere φ is the angle between the normal to the area element and the vertical. But ΔS cos φ is the area of the projection of the element ΔS on the horizontal plane. Hence the total field strength at point O can be determined from the formula\nE' = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (σS / R²),\nwhere S is the area of the hatched figure in Fig. 207, which is the projection of the lobule on the horizontal plane xOy. Since the area of any narrow strip of this region (black region in Fig. 207) is smaller than the area of the corresponding strip of the large circle by a factor of sin(α/2), the entire area of the hatched region is smaller than the area of the large circle by a factor of sin(α/2). Hence\nE' = (σS) / (4πε₀R²) = (σ / (4πε₀R²)) * πR² sin(α/2) = (σ sin(α/2)) / (4ε₀).\nIn the case of a hemisphere, α = π and\nE = σ / (4ε₀)."

For this purpose, we append to the initial lobule another lobule with an angle π - α.

It can easily be seen that vectors E and E' are mutually perpendicular, and their vector sum is equal to the electric field vector of the hemisphere at its centre.

    "Answers": "3.6. We choose two small arbitrary elements belonging to the surfaces of the first and second hemispheres and having the areas ΔS₁ and ΔS₂. Let the separation between the two elements be r₁₂. The force of interaction between the two elements can be determined from Coulomb's law:\nΔF₁₂ = (1 / (4πε₀)) * (1/r₁₂²) * σ₁ΔS₁ * σ₂ΔS₂ = (ΔS₁ΔS₂ / (4πε₀r₁₂²)) * σ₁σ₂.\nIn order to determine the total force of interaction between the hemispheres, we must, proceeding from the superposition principle, sum up the forces ΔF₁₂ for all the interacting pairs of elements so that the resultant force of interaction between the hemispheres is\nF = kσ₁σ₂,\nwhere the coefficient k is determined only by the geometry of the charge distribution and by the choice of the system of units. If the hemispheres were charged with the same surface density σ, the corresponding force of interaction between the hemispheres would be\nF̃ = kσ²,\nwhere the coefficient k is the same as in the previous formula.\nLet us determine the force F̃. For this purpose, we consider the “upper” hemisphere. Its small surface element of area ΔS carries a charge Δq = σΔS and experiences the action of the electric field whose strength E' is equal to half the electric field strength produced by the sphere having a radius R and uniformly charged with the surface density σ. (We must exclude the part produced by the charge Δq itself from the electric field strength.) The force acting on the charge Δq is\nΔF = ΔqE' = σΔS * (1 / (4πε₀)) * (σ * 4πR² / (R² * 2)) = (σ² / (2ε₀))ΔS\nand is directed along the normal to the surface element. In order to find the force acting on the upper hemisphere, it should be noted that according to the expression for the force ΔF the hemisphere as if experiences the action of an effective pressure p̃ = σ²/(2ε₀). Hence the resultant force acting on the upper hemisphere is\nF̃ = p̃πR² = (σ² / (2ε₀))πR²\n(although not only the “lower” hemisphere, but all the elements of the “upper” hemisphere make a contribution to the expression ΔF for the force acting on the surface element ΔS, the forces of interaction between the elements of the upper hemisphere will be cancelled out in the general expression for the force of interaction between the hemispheres obtained above).\nSince F̃ = kσ², we obtain the following expression for the force of interaction between the hemispheres for the case when they have different surface charge densities:\nF = kσ₁σ₂ = (πR² / (2ε₀))σ₁σ₂."

The force acting on the hemispheres is proportional to the field strength:\nF ∝ σSE ∝ R²E²,\nwhere S is the area of the hemisphere, and R is its radius. As the radius of the sphere changes by a factor of n, and the field strength by a factor of k, the force will change by a factor of k²n². Since the thickness of the sphere walls remains unchanged, the force tearing the sphere per unit length must remain unchanged, i.e. k²n²/n = 1 and k = 1/√n = 1/√2.

The obtained circuit cannot be simplified by connecting or disconnecting junctions (or by removing some conductors) so as to obtain parallel- or series-connected subcircuits. However, any problem involving a direct current has a single solution, which we shall try to “guess” by using the symmetry of the circuit and the similarity of the currents in the circuit.\nLet us apply a voltage U to the circuit and mark currents through each element of the circuit. We shall require not nine values of current (as in the case of arbitrary resistances of circuit elements) but only five values I₁, I₂, I₃, I₄, and I₅ (Fig. 214). For such currents, Kirchhoff's first rule for the junction C\nI₁ = I₃ + I₅\nand for the junction D\nI₄ + I₂ = I₃ + I₅\nwill automatically be observed for the junctions E and F (this is due to the equality of the resistances of all resistors of the circuit).

Before switching the key K, no current flows through the resistor of resistance R, and the charge on the capacitor of capacitance C₂ can be determined from the formula\nq = EC₂.\nThe energy stored in this capacitor is found from the formula\nW_C₂ = E²C₂/2.\nAfter switching the key K, the charge q is redistributed between two capacitors so that the charge q₁ on the capacitor of capacitance C₁ and the charge q₂ on the capacitor of capacitance C₂ can be calculated from the formulas\nq₁ + q₂ = q, q₁/C₁ = q₂/C₂.\nThe total energy of the two capacitors will be\nW_(C₁+C₂) = q²/(2(C₁ + C₂)) = (E²C₂²)/(2(C₁ + C₂)).\nTherefore, the amount of heat Q liberated in the resistor can be obtained from the relation\nQ = E²C₂/2 - (E²C₂²)/(2(C₁ + C₂)) = (E²C₁C₂)/(2(C₁ + C₂))."

Determine the distance s covered by the jumper before it comes to rest. How does the direction of induction B affect the answer?\n[Image of Fig. 106]",
    "Answers": "3.48. During the motion of the jumper, the magnetic flux through the circuit formed by the jumper, rails, and the resistor changes. An emf is induced in the circuit, and a current is generated. As a result of the action of the magnetic field on the current in the jumper, the latter will be decelerated.\nLet us determine the decelerating force F. Let the velocity of the jumper at a certain instant be v. During a short time interval Δt, the jumper is shifted along the rails by a small distance Δx = vΔt. The change in the area embraced by the circuit is vdΔt, and the magnetic flux varies by ΔΦ = BvdΔt during this time. The emf induced in the circuit is\nE = -ΔΦ/Δt = -Bvd.\nAccording to Ohm's law, the current through the jumper is I = E/R. The force exerted by the magnetic field on the jumper is\nF = IBd = -B²d²v/R.\nAccording to Lenz's law, the force F is directed against the velocity v of the jumper.\nLet us now write the equation of motion for the jumper (over a small distance Δx):\nma = F = -B²d²v/R.\nConsidering that a = Δv/Δt and v = Δx/Δt, we obtain\nmΔv = - (B²d²Δx)/R.\nIt can be seen that the change in the velocity of the jumper is proportional to the change in its x-coordinate (at the initial instant, x₀ = 0). Therefore, the total change in velocity v_f - v₀ = 0 - v₀ = -v₀ is connected with the change in the coordinate (with the total displacement s) through the relation\nm(-v₀) = -(B²d²s)/R.\nHence we can determine the length of the path covered by the jumper before it comes to rest:\ns = mRv₀/(B²d²).\nWhen the direction of the magnetic induction B forms an angle α with the normal to the plane of the rails, we obtain\ns = mRv₀/(B²d²cos²α).\nIndeed, the induced emf, and hence the current through the jumper, is determined by the magnetic flux through the circuit, and in this case, the flux is determined by the projection of the magnetic induction B on the normal to the plane of the circuit."

When the metal ball moves in the magnetic field, the free electrons are distributed over the surface of the ball due to the action of the Lorentz force so that the resultant electric field in the bulk of the ball is uniform and compensates the action of the magnetic field.

    "Answers": "3.52. The magnetic induction of the solenoid is directed along its axis. Therefore, the Lorentz force acting on the electron at any instant of time will lie in the plane perpendicular to the solenoid axis. Since the electron velocity at the initial moment is directed at right angles to the solenoid axis, the electron trajectory will lie in the plane perpendicular to the solenoid axis. The Lorentz force can be found from the formula F = evB.\nThe trajectory of the electron in the solenoid is an arc of the circle whose radius can be determined from the relation evB = mv²/r, whence\nr = mv/eB.\nThe trajectory of the electron is shown in Fig. 223 (top view), where O₁ is the centre of the arc AC described by the electron, v' is the velocity at which the electron leaves the solenoid. The segments OA and OC are tangents to the electron trajectory at points A and C. The angle between v and v' is obviously φ = ∠AO₁C since ∠OAO₁ = ∠OCO₁. In order to find φ, let us consider the right triangle OAO₁: side OA = R and side AO₁ = r. Therefore, tan(φ/2) = R/r = eBR/(mv). Therefore,\nφ = 2 arctan(eBR/mv).\nObviously, the magnitude of the velocity remains unchanged over the entire trajectory since the Lorentz force is perpendicular to the velocity at any instant. Therefore, the transit time of electron in the solenoid can be determined from the relation\nt = rφ/v = mφ/eB = (2m/eB)arctan(eBR/mv)."

    "Answers": "3.56*. Let N₁ be the number of turns of the coil of inductance L₁, and N₂ be the number of turns of the coil of inductance L₂. It should be noted that the required composite coil of inductance L can be treated as a coil with N = N₁ + N₂ turns. If the relation between the inductance and the number of turns is known, L can be expressed in terms of L₁ and L₂. For a given geometrical configuration of the coil, such a relation must actually exist because inductance is determined only by geometrical configuration and the number of turns of the coil (we speak of long cylindrical coils with uniform winding). Let us derive this relation.\nFrom the superposition principle for a magnetic field, it follows that the magnetic field produced by a current I in a coil of a given size is proportional to the number of turns in it. Indeed, the doubling of the number of turns in the coil can be treated as a replacement of each turn by two new closely located turns. These two turns will produce twice as strong a field as that produced by a single turn since the fields produced by two turns are added. Therefore, the field in a coil with twice as many turns is twice as strong. Thus, B ∝ N (B is the magnetic induction, and the current is fixed). It should be noted that the magnetic flux embraced by the turns of the coil is\nΦ = BNS ∝ BN ∝ N².\nIt remains for us to consider that\nL = Φ/I ∝ N².\nThus, we obtain L = kN² for a given geometry.
