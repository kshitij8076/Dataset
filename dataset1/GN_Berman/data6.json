    "Answers": "The given series cannot be differentiated term by term in any interval. For, the general term in the series of derivatives has the form πcos(2ⁿπx). No matter how small the interval (α, β), and no matter where it lies on the real axis, a number of the form k/2ⁿ can always be found inside it, where k is an integer and N a sufficiently large positive integer.
