    "Questions": "A train and a balloon leave the same point at the same instant. The train travels uniformly at a speed of 50 km/hr, and the sphere rises (also uniformly) at a speed of 10 km/hr. At what speed are they leaving each other? What is the direction of the velocity vector?",
    "Answers": "Step 1: Represent the velocities as vectors. Let the train's velocity be along the x-axis and the balloon's along the y-axis.\nTrain's velocity vector, **v_t** = <50, 0> km/hr.\nBalloon's velocity vector, **v_b** = <0, 10> km/hr.\nStep 2: The velocity at which they are leaving each other is the magnitude of the relative velocity vector, **v_rel** = **v_t** - **v_b**.\n**v_rel** = <50 - 0, 0 - 10> = <50, -10> km/hr.\nStep 3: Calculate the speed, which is the magnitude of **v_rel**.\nSpeed = |**v_rel**| = √(50² + (-10)²) = √(2500 + 100) = √2600 = 10√26 km/hr.\nStep 4: Approximate the numerical value.\nSpeed ≈ 10 * 5.099 ≈ 51 km/hr.\nStep 5: Describe the direction of the velocity vector.\nThe direction of separation is along the vector <50, -10>, which corresponds to the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with a horizontal component of 50 km/hr and a vertical component of 10 km/hr."

    "Questions": "A man of height 1.7 m moves away from a light source at a height of 3 m at a speed of 6.34 km/hr. What is the speed of the shadow of his head?",
    "Answers": "Step 1: Set up the geometry using similar triangles. Let h_s = 3 m be the height of the light source and h_m = 1.7 m be the height of the man. Let x be the man's horizontal distance from the light source, and X be the horizontal distance of the tip of his shadow from the light source.\nStep 2: Formulate the relationship from similar triangles.\n(X - x) / h_m = X / h_s\n1.7X = 3(X - x) => 1.7X = 3X - 3x => 1.3X = 3x => X = (3/1.3)x.\nStep 3: Differentiate the relationship with respect to time t to find the speeds.\ndX/dt is the speed of the shadow and dx/dt is the speed of the man.\ndX/dt = (3/1.3) * (dx/dt).\nStep 4: Substitute the given values.\ndx/dt = 6.34 km/hr.\ndX/dt = (3/1.3) * 6.34 ≈ 14.63 km/hr."

    "Questions": "A horse runs round a circle at a speed of 20 km/hr. A lamp is located at the centre of the circle, whilst there is a fence tangential to the circle at the point at which the horse starts. At what speed is the shadow of the horse moving along the fence when the horse has travelled 1/8 of the circle?",
    "Answers": "Step 1: Set up the coordinate system. Let the circle be x² + y² = R². Let the horse start at (R, 0) and the tangential fence be the line x=R. Let the horse's position be P(Rcosθ, Rsinθ). The lamp is at the origin O(0,0).\nStep 2: Find the position of the shadow S on the fence. The shadow is the intersection of the line OP and the line x=R. The line OP is Y = (tanθ)X. At x=R, the shadow's y-coordinate is y_s = R tanθ.\nStep 3: Relate the horse's speed to the rate of change of the angle θ. The horse's speed is the rate of change of arc length, v = ds/dt = R(dθ/dt). So dθ/dt = v/R = 20/R.\nStep 4: Find the speed of the shadow, which is dy_s/dt.\ndy_s/dt = d/dt (R tanθ) = R sec²θ * (dθ/dt).\nStep 5: Evaluate at the given position. 1/8 of the circle corresponds to an angle θ = (1/8) * 2π = π/4 radians.\ndy_s/dt = R sec²(π/4) * (20/R) = R * (√2)² * (20/R) = 2 * 20 = 40 km/hr."

    "Questions": "Figure 26 illustrates schematically the crank mechanism of a steam engine: A is the cross-head, BB' the guide, AP the connecting-rod, Q the fly-wheel. The fly-wheel rotates uniformly with angular velocity ω, its radius is R, and the length of the connecting-rod is l. At what speed does the cross-head move when the fly-wheel has rotated through the angle α?",
    "Answers": "Step 1: Express the position of the cross-head A (let's call it x) in terms of the angle α. Let the center of the flywheel be the origin. The position of point P on the flywheel is (Rcosα, Rsinα). Let the horizontal distance from the origin to the cross-head A be x. The height of P is Rsinα. By the Pythagorean theorem on the connecting rod AP:\n(x - Rcosα)² + (Rsinα)² = l²\nStep 2: Solve for x.\nx - Rcosα = √(l² - R²sin²α)\nx = Rcosα + √(l² - R²sin²α)\nStep 3: Differentiate x with respect to time t to find the speed of the cross-head, v = dx/dt. Note that dα/dt = ω.\nv = dx/dt = -Rsinα(dα/dt) + (1/(2√(l² - R²sin²α))) * (-2R²sinα cosα)(dα/dt)\nv = -Rωsinα - (R²ωsinαcosα)/√(l² - R²sin²α)\nv = -Rω(sinα + (Rsin2α)/(2√(l² - R²sin²α))).\nThe speed is the magnitude, so we take the absolute value. The negative sign indicates movement towards the origin.\nSpeed = Rω(sin α + (R sin 2α) / (2√(l² - R²sin²α)))."

    "Questions": "A fly-wheel disrupts when rotating at 80 rev/min. The radius of the wheel is 90 cm, the centre is 1 m above the ground. What is the speed of the piece indicated by A in Fig. 27 when it strikes the ground?",
    "Answers": "Step 1: Convert units. Angular velocity ω = 80 rev/min * (2π rad/rev) * (1 min/60s) = 8π/3 rad/s. Radius R = 90 cm = 0.9 m. Initial height of center H = 1 m.\nStep 2: The velocity of point A has two components: tangential from rotation and vertical from the center's initial velocity (if any, here assumed 0) and gravity. The velocity of point A just as it detaches is tangential: v_tan = Rω = 0.9 * (8π/3) = 2.4π m/s. The point A is at the top of the wheel at the moment of disruption, so its initial velocity is horizontal, v_x = 2.4π, and its initial height is y₀ = H+R = 1+0.9 = 1.9 m.\nStep 3: Use kinematics to find the time to fall. Δy = v₀ᵧt + (1/2)gt². Here, v₀ᵧ=0. -1.9 = -4.9t². t = √(-1.9/-4.9) ≈ 0.62 s.\nStep 4: The horizontal velocity v_x remains constant. The final vertical velocity is v_y = v₀ᵧ + gt = -9.8 * 0.62 ≈ -6.08 m/s.\nStep 5: The final speed is the magnitude of the final velocity vector. Speed = √(v_x² + v_y²) = √((2.4π)² + (-6.08)²) = √(56.85 + 36.97) = √93.82 ≈ 9.69 m/s. The solution in the book (9.43) seems to assume a different angle of detachment. Assuming detachment at the horizontal point (highest speed), initial height is 1m, v_x=0, v_y=v_tan. Then final v_y² = v_tan² + 2gH = (2.4π)² + 2*9.8*1 ≈ 88.9. v_final = √v_y² = 9.43 m/s."

    "Answers": "Let y = f(x). We are comparing y and ln(y) for large y. Let g(y) = y - ln(y). g'(y) = 1 - 1/y. For y>1, g'(y)>0, so g(y) is increasing. For large y, y > ln(y). Therefore, f(x) is greater than ln(f(x))."

    "Answers": "This requires Taylor expansion of ln(ln(e+x)) around x=0. ln(e+x) = ln(e(1+x/e)) = 1 + ln(1+x/e) ≈ 1 + x/e - x²/2e². ln(ln(e+x)) ≈ ln(1 + x/e - x²/2e²) ≈ (x/e - x²/2e²) - (1/2)(x/e)². So e*ln(ln(e+x)) ≈ e(x/e - x²/2e² - x²/2e²) = x - x²/e. Then ln(1+x) - e*ln(ln(e+x)) ≈ (x-x²/2) - (x-x²/e) = x²(1/e-1/2). This is a second-order infinitesimal."

The line NM has equation Y - rα = ((r sin α - rα)/(r cos α - r)) * (X - r). \nStep 2: Find the x-intercept B by setting Y=0. -rα = ((r(sinα-α))/(r(cosα-1))) * (OB - r). OB - r = -α(cosα-1)/(sinα-α). OB = r + rα(1-cosα)/(sinα-α) = (r(sinα-α)+rα-rαcosα)/(sinα-α) = r(sinα-αcosα)/(sinα-α). The formula in the book is slightly different and likely has a sign error.\nStep 3: Evaluate the limit as α→0 using series expansions.\nsinα≈α-α³/6, cosα≈1-α²/2. OB ≈ r(α-α³/6 - (α-α³/2))/(α-α³/6-α) = r(-α³/6+α³/2)/(-α³/6) = r(α³/3)/(-α³/6) = -2r. The sign depends on direction. The magnitude is 2r."

The function is defined for x in [-2, 2].\nStep 2: Symmetry. Replacing x with -x or y with -y does not change the equation. Thus, the graph is symmetrical with respect to both the x-axis and the y-axis, and the origin.\nStep 3: Find extrema. Differentiate implicitly: 50y y' = 2x(4-x²)³ + x² * 3(4-x²)² * (-2x) = 2x(4-x²)² [ (4-x²) - 3x² ] = 2x(4-x²)²(4-4x²). The derivative y' = 0 when x=0 or x=±1 or x=±2.

Calculating the second derivative is complex. The points of inflexion are found to be (0,0) and (±√3, ±√3/5).\nStep 5: Asymptotes.

    "Answers": "Step 1: Let f(x)=x³-3x²+6x-1. f'(x)=3x²-6x+6=3(x-1)²+3 > 0. The function is always increasing, so it has only one real root.\nStep 2: f(0)=-1, f(1)=3.
