    "Answers": "p = (p₀/∫e^(kω²x²/I)dx) * ∫e^(kω²x²/I)dx, where k = M/(2p₀IS). An important practical case is that when ω is very large (centrifuge). Instead of working out the integral in the denominator for a given ω (it is not expressed in elementary functions), lim(ω→∞) p is evaluated (see problem 2439). By using the same argument as when deducing the barometric formula (see Course, sec. 122), we obtain the differential equation S dp = ω²x dm, where dm is the mass of element CD. Further, γ=2kp (one of the forms of the Boyle-Marriotte law; the coefficient of proportionality is written as 2k in future for simplicity); dm = γS dx = 2kpS dx. As a result, the equation with separated variables dp/p = 2kω²x dx is obtained. Integration of this gives: p=Ce^(kω²x²), where C is the constant of integration. Further, M = ∫dm = C2kS∫e^(kω²x²)dx, whence C is found. We have: p = (Me^(kω²x²)) / (2kS∫e^(kω²x²)dx), but y₀ = 2kp₀, so k = y₀/(2p₀), M/(IS)=M/(k*2p₀*IS) = M/(2p₀IS) and finally p = p₀e^(kω²x²)/∫e^(kω²x²)dx."
