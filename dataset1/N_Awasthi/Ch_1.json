It is simply removed by boiling as Ca(HCO3)2 → CaCO3↓ + CO2↑ + H2O, Mg(HCO3)2 → MgCO3↓ + CO2↑ + H2O. Temporary hardness can also be removed by addition of slaked lime, Ca(OH)2. Permanent hardness is due to presence of sulphate and chlorides of Ca, Mg, etc. It is removed by washing soda as CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3↓ + 2NaCl. Permanent hardness also removed by ion exchange resin process as 2RH + Ca^2+ → R2Ca + 2H+.

Hardness has been classified into two types (i) Temporary hardness (ii) Permanent hardness. Temporary hardness is due to presence of calcium and magnesium bicarbonate. It is simply removed by boiling as Ca(HCO3)2 → CaCO3↓ + CO2↑ + H2O, Mg(HCO3)2 → MgCO3↓ + CO2↑ + H2O. Temporary hardness can also be removed by addition of slaked lime, Ca(OH)2. Permanent hardness is due to presence of sulphate and chlorides of Ca, Mg, etc. It is removed by washing soda as CaCl2 + Na2CO3 → CaCO3↓ + 2NaCl. Permanent hardness also removed by ion exchange resin process as 2RH + Ca^2+ → R2Ca + 2H+. The degree of hardness of water is measured in terms of ppm of CaCO3. 100 ppm means 100 g of CaCO3 is present in 10^6 g of H2O.
