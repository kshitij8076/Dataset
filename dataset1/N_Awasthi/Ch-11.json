    "solution": "Silica gel is a widely used adsorbent for moisture due to its porous structure and large surface area. Anhydrous CaCl₂ also absorbs water but it does so by chemical reaction to form a hydrate, which is absorption/chemisorption rather than physical adsorption. Silica gel is the classic example for this context."

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "solution": "An adsorption isobar plots the extent of adsorption (x/m) against temperature (T) at constant pressure. For Chemisorption, it's an activated process, so the rate first increases with temperature to overcome the activation energy, then decreases because it's exothermic. This gives a curve that rises to a maximum and then falls. For Physisorption, it's a non-activated exothermic process, so the extent of adsorption continuously decreases as temperature increases. Option (c) shows the correct pair of graphs in the correct order."

    },
    "correct_answer": "d",

    "solution": "Statement (d) is incorrect. Lyophobic means 'solvent-hating'. The particles in a lyophobic sol have little to no affinity for the dispersion medium and are not significantly solvated or hydrated. They are stabilized primarily by their surface charge. Lyophilic sols, in contrast, are extensively hydrated."

    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "solution": "While lyophilic particles can acquire a small charge, it is not their primary characteristic or a universal property, unlike lyophobic sols. Their stability comes mainly from the extensive solvation (hydration) and strong interaction with the medium. Statements (a), (b), and (d) are all key correct characteristics of lyophilic sols.

    "solution": "Muddy water is a colloidal solution of negatively charged clay particles. Alum (like potash alum, KAl(SO₄)₂) provides highly charged cations, primarily Al³⁺. According to the Hardy-Schulze rule, these cations effectively neutralize the charge on the clay particles, causing them to aggregate (coagulate) and settle down, thus clarifying the water."

      "d": "there is strong electrostatic repulsion between the colloidal particles"
    },
    "correct_answer": "c",
    "solution": "The stability of lyophilic sols is due to two main factors: the charge on the particles and, more importantly, the extensive solvation (hydration) of the particles. This solvation layer acts as a protective barrier that prevents the particles from aggregating. Lyophobic sols are stabilized only by their charge."

    "correct_answer": "b",
    "solution": "As₂S₃ sol is a negatively charged colloid, so its coagulation depends on the charge of the cation. The cations are K⁺, Ca²⁺, Na⁺, and Al³⁺. According to the Hardy-Schulze rule, coagulation power increases with the magnitude of the charge. The charges are: Al³⁺ (+3) > Ca²⁺ (+2) > K⁺ (+1) = Na⁺ (+1).

(c) is true because oil is the dispersed phase and will not mix with the medium. (d) is true because water is the medium and can conduct electricity if an electrolyte is added. (b) is not true; an oil-soluble dye will only color the dispersed oil droplets, not the entire emulsion, since the continuous phase is water."

    "correct_answer": "a",
    "solution": "Migration towards the cathode means the sol particles are positively charged. Coagulation will be caused by the anions: Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, and PO₄³⁻. Coagulating power is proportional to the magnitude of the charge: PO₄³⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > Cl⁻. Coagulation value is the minimum concentration needed and is inversely proportional to coagulating power. Therefore, the order of coagulation values is Cl⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > PO₄³⁻. The maximum coagulation value will be for NaCl."

    "correct_answer": "c",
    "solution": "Associated colloids are formed by surfactants. Surfactants are surface-active agents, meaning they accumulate at the surface and lower the surface tension of the solvent. The formation of large, aggregated micelles in the solution increases the resistance to flow, thereby raising the viscosity. So, they lower surface tension and raise viscosity."

    "correct_answer": "d",
    "solution": "Fe(OH)₃ sol is positively charged. In electrophoresis, the sol particles would move to the cathode. In electro-osmosis, the movement of sol particles is prevented. Due to the electrical double layer, the dispersion medium acquires a charge opposite to that of the particles. Since the particles are positive, the medium is effectively negative and will move towards the positive electrode (anode). (Note: The provided answer key says (B), which describes electrophoresis, not electro-osmosis. Let's re-read the solution text: 'medium is negatively charged'. If the medium is negative, it moves to the anode. There is a contradiction in the materials provided. I will assume the logic that Fe(OH)₃ is positive, so the medium is negative and moves to the anode (c). However, the key says (B), which is the movement of particles. This is a common confusion. If the question implies the setup of electrophoresis, then (b) is the answer. The provided solution PDF also points to (c). This question has conflicting information)."

    "solution": "Ferric hydroxide sol is positively charged, so it is coagulated by anions. The anions are PO₄³⁻, Cl⁻, SO₄²⁻, and [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻. According to the Hardy-Schulze rule, coagulating power increases with charge magnitude: [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ > PO₄³⁻ > SO₄²⁻ > Cl⁻. Coagulation value is inversely proportional to coagulating power. Therefore, the increasing order of coagulation value is: [Fe(CN)₆]⁴⁻ < PO₄³⁻ < SO₄²⁻ < Cl⁻, which corresponds to IV < I < III < II. The question asks for increasing order. The answer should be IV < I < III < II. Option (b) is II > III > I > IV, which is the decreasing order. There might be a typo in the question or options.
