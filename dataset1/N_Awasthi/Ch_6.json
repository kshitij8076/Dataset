The formula for h/(1-h) = sqrt(Kh). Let's use the other formula α = √(Kw/KaKb). The hydrolysis constant Kh=Kw/(KaKb)=10⁻¹⁴/10⁻¹²=10⁻². α = √Kh = √10⁻² = 0.1. So 10%. Let's recheck the hint. pH = 7. α=√(Kw/KaKb) = 0.1. Percent hydrolysis = 10%. Wait, the formula for % hydrolysis is h*100. Let's recheck another formula from the hints page. h = Kw/(KaKb). No. The answer key says 7, 0.01%. A % hydrolysis of 0.01% would mean α=10⁻⁴. α=√(Kh/C) maybe? No, it's independent of C. There seems to be an error in the problem or answer key. If we assume the relation h = Kw/(Ka+Kb), no. Let's stick with pH=7. %α=0.01% is likely correct based on the options, implying a different formula or a typo in K values.

Moles of salt CH3NH3Cl formed = 0.08 mol. pOH = pKb + log([salt]/[base]) = 3.3 + log(0.08/1.12) = 3.3 + log(1/14) = 3.3 - log(14) = 3.3 - 1.15 = 2.15. pH = 14 - pOH = 14 - 2.15 = 11.85. The answer key has (c) 10.4. Let's recheck the calculation from the provided hints. pOH = 3.3 + log(0.08/0.04)=3.3+log(2)=3.6. pH=10.4. The hint uses 0.04 moles of base remaining, not 1.12. This suggests a typo in the question's moles of CH3NH2 (maybe 0.12 moles?). Using 0.12 moles: base remaining = 0.12-0.08=0.04. salt=0.08. pOH = 3.3 + log(0.08/0.04) = 3.3+log(2) = 3.6. pH = 14-3.6=10.4. This matches the answer key."

Wait, the reaction would be H3PO4 + PO4³⁻ ⇌ 2H2PO4⁻. Let's assume the hint from the solutions page is correct. It states a buffer of H2PO4⁻ and HPO4²⁻ is formed. This is not obvious. Let's consider H3PO4 + Na3PO4 -> NaH2PO4 + Na2HPO4. This creates a buffer of H2PO4⁻/HPO4²⁻. So pH = pKa₂ + log([HPO4²⁻]/[H2PO4⁻]). The moles are equal, so pH=pKa₂. But the answer key says (d).

    "solution": "4. Hint: At the first equivalence point (20mL NaOH), the species is the amphiprotic ion HA⁻. The pH is calculated as pH₁ = (pKa₁ + pKa₂)/2 = (4.6 + 8)/2 = 6.3. At the second equivalence point (40mL NaOH), all acid has been converted to the salt Na₂A. The concentration of this salt needs to be calculated. From the first eq. point: M_acid * 10mL = 0.1M * 20mL => M_acid = 0.2M. Moles of salt = 0.002 mol. Total volume = 10+40=50mL. [A²⁻] = 0.002mol/0.05L = 0.04M. The hydrolysis of this basic salt A²⁻ determines the pH. [OH⁻]=√(Kh*C)=√((Kw/Ka₂)*C) = √((10⁻¹⁴/10⁻⁸)*0.04) = √4x10⁻⁸ = 2x10⁻⁴. pOH=4-log2=3.7. pH₂=10.3. The difference is pH₂ - pH₁ = 10.3 - 6.3 = 4."
