Ea/R = ln(2) * 8700.\nCase 2: Find the factor for a rise from 17°C (290K) to 27°C (300K). We need to find k(300K)/k(290K). Oh, the first part is for a change FROM 7°C, which is 280K. It doubles when temp changes from 7°C, assuming a 10K rise to 17°C (280K to 290K). So ln(2)=(Ea/R)[(1/280)-(1/290)]. Ea/R = ln(2)*280*290/10 = ln(2)*8120. Now find the factor for 17°C (290K) to 27°C (300K). Let this factor be x. ln(x) = (Ea/R)[(1/290)-(1/300)] = (ln(2)*8120) * [10/(290*300)] = ln(2) * 8120 / 8700 = ln(2) * 0.933. x = 2^0.933 ≈ 1.91."

Both statements (a) and (b) describe events that occur during beta decay. Note: The provided answer key may be incorrect; based on the nuclear process, (c) is the most complete description."

Losing an α particle (⁹⁰Th -> ⁸⁸Ra) forms Radium, which is an alkaline earth metal in Group 2 (IIA). The options and older group naming are confusing.

Wait, there is a mistake in derivation from the solution hint. Let's recheck the hint. The hint has 3P∞ - Pₜ, which seems off. Let's use the standard formula for A -> nB. P∞ = nP₀. Here, n=3. P∞ = 3P₀. Pₜ = P₀ + (n-1)x = P₀ + 2x. P_A = P₀ - x. From Pₜ, x = (Pₜ-P₀)/2. P_A = P₀ - (Pₜ-P₀)/2 = (3P₀ - Pₜ)/2.

We need to eliminate P₀ and x. P₀ = P∞/3. P_A = P∞/3 - (Pₜ - P∞/3)/2 = P∞/3 - Pₜ/2 + P∞/6 = P∞/2 - Pₜ/2 = (P∞-Pₜ)/2. So k = (2.303/t)log(P₀/P_A) = (2.303/t)log((P∞/3)/((P∞-Pₜ)/2)) = (2.303/t)log(2P∞/(3(P∞-Pₜ))). Still no match. There appears to be an error in the question or options. Option (c) is `log(P∞/(3P∞ - 2Pₜ))`. If P_A = (3P∞ - 2Pₜ)/3, this would work. Let's see if we can get that. (3P₀-Pₜ)/2... no. The provided options and standard derivation do not match."

Pressure of water P_H₂O = 28 torr.\nAt t=10 min: P_total = 188 torr. Pressure of gases = 188 - 28 = 160 torr. Let x be the pressure of A reacted. P_A = P₀-x, P_B = 2x, P_C = x. Total gas pressure P_t_gas = (P₀-x) + 2x + x = P₀ + 2x = 160.\nAt t=∞: P_total = 388 torr. Pressure of gases P∞_gas = 388 - 28 = 360 torr. At infinity, all A has reacted. P_A=0, P_B=2P₀, P_C=P₀.

Let's re-read the overall rate constant: `k = k₂ * (k₁ / (k₃k₅))¹/²` - this is `k₂ * k₁¹/² * k₃⁻¹/² * k₅⁻¹/²`. My formula is correct. Let's re-read the activation energies given in order. 40, 60, 50, 10. `E_a1=40, E_a2=60, E_a3=50, E_a5=10`. Re-calculate: `60 + 0.5*40 - 0.5*50 - 0.5*10 = 60 + 20 - 25 - 5 = 50`. Still 50. Let's check the hint for Q20 on page 46. `Ea = Ea(2) - Ea(3) + 1/2 Ea(1) - 1/2 Ea(5)`. Wait, why `Ea(2) - Ea(3)`? The expression is `k = k₂...`. My formula `Ea = a*Ea₁ + b*Ea₂ + ...` is correct. Let's assume the question meant `k = (k₁*k₂ / (k₃k₅))¹/²`. Then `Ea = 0.5*Ea1 + 0.5*Ea2 - 0.5*Ea3 - 0.5*Ea5 = 0.5*(40+60-50-10) = 0.5*40 = 20`. This matches option (b). Let's assume the question meant `k = k₁ * (k₂ / (k₃k₅))¹/²`. Then `Ea = Ea1 + 0.5*Ea2 - 0.5*Ea3 - 0.5*Ea5 = 40 + 0.5*60 - 0.5*50 - 0.5*10 = 40 + 30 - 25 - 5 = 40`. The provided answer key says 20(c). Option (c) is 25. Let's try `k = k₁ (k₂/(k₃*k₅))`. No. The original form seems most plausible. Let's recheck the calculation `60+20-25-5=50`. The question or options are definitely flawed. If we assume the activation energies are for steps 1, 2, 3, and 4 (not 5) and the 5th step is `k4`, then the expression is still unclear. Let's work backwards from the answer 25. `Ea_overall = 25`. Maybe `Ea = Ea₂ + (Ea₁ - Ea₃ - Ea₅)/2`. `60 + (40 - 50 - 10)/2 = 60 - 10 = 50`. No. What if `Ea = Ea₁ + (Ea₂ - Ea₃ - Ea₅)/2`? `40 + (60 - 50 - 10)/2 = 40`. No. Given the high chance of error in the source, it's impossible to derive the answer 25."

Multi-step mechanism: There will be multiple intermediates (IAB, AB) and thus multiple peaks.\n3. First step is a fast equilibrium: A+B ⇌ IAB. This suggests a relatively low activation barrier to form the first intermediate IAB.\n4. Second step is slow (RDS): IAB + I → AB + I. This is the rate-determining step, so it must have the highest activation energy barrier in the entire sequence. The peak corresponding to this step should be the highest.\n5. Third step: AB + I → P + A. The problem states k₁ << k₂. In this notation, k₁ and k₂ are not rate constants for steps 2 and 3, but seem to refer to something else, possibly related to the intermediates. The text `slow k₁` and `k₂` is confusing.

    "solution": "To find the correct potential energy diagram, we must identify the rate-determining step (RDS), which is the slowest step in the mechanism. This step will have the highest activation energy barrier.\nThe mechanism given is:\n(I) ⇌ (II) (fast)\n(II) + C₂H₅OH → (III) (slow, k₂)\n(III) ⇌ (IV) (fast)\n(IV) ⇌ (V) (slow, k₄)\n(V) ⇌ (VI) (fast)\nThere are two slow steps indicated: the addition of ethanol to the protonated acid (II → III) and the loss of water from intermediate (IV → V). In such cases, the overall rate is complex, but the potential energy diagram should show significant activation barriers for both of these steps. The transition states for these slow steps (TS for II→III and TS for IV→V) should represent the highest points in the energy profile. Graph (a) shows a multi-step reaction with several intermediates (valleys). It correctly depicts two major peaks, corresponding to the two slow steps, making it the most plausible representation of the given mechanism."

    "solution": "This problem describes a scenario where a nuclide is being produced at a constant rate (R) and simultaneously decaying. The number of atoms N at time t is given by N = (R/λ)(1 - e⁻ˡᵗ).\n1. Find λ: t₁/₂ = 30 min. λ = 0.693 / 30 ≈ 0.0231 min⁻¹.\n2. At t = 90 min, Activity A = 100 dis/min. A = λN. So, N(at 90min) = A/λ = 100 / 0.0231 ≈ 4329 atoms.\n3. Find the production rate (R): 4329 = (R/0.0231)(1 - e^(-0.0231 * 90)) = (R/0.0231)(1 - e⁻²·⁰⁷⁹) = (R/0.0231)(1 - 0.125) = (R/0.0231)(0.875). R = (4329 * 0.0231) / 0.875 ≈ 114.3 atoms/min.\n4. The question asks 'how many atoms were prepared initially', which usually means the total number produced (R*t), not 'present initially'. Total atoms produced = R * t = 114.3 atoms/min * 90 min ≈ 10287 atoms. This does not match. Let's re-read. 'how many atoms of the nuclide were prepared initially?'. This is very poor wording. It could mean the total number of atoms N₀ that would give this activity if they were all present at t=0 and just decayed. Let's try that. A = A₀e⁻ˡᵗ => A₀ = A / e⁻ˡᵗ = 100 / e⁻²·⁰⁷⁹ = 100 / 0.125 = 800 dis/min. N₀ = A₀/λ = 800 / 0.0231 ≈ 34632 atoms ≈ 3.46 x 10⁴. This matches option (b). The question is asking for the initial number of atoms if it were a simple decay problem, not a production-decay problem."

An elementary reaction must have integer orders corresponding to its molecularity. A fractional order like 3/2 indicates a complex reaction mechanism.\nd) Correct.

The half-life for a zero-order reaction is given by t₁/₂ = [A]₀ / (2k). As the reaction progresses, the concentration of the reactant decreases.

The actual rate law is Rate = k[ester][H₂O]. However, because water is the solvent, it is present in such a large excess that its concentration remains effectively constant throughout the reaction.

    "solution": "The assertion is a well-known rule of thumb in chemical kinetics for reactions occurring near room temperature. The reason is TRUE and correctly explains the assertion. The rate constant (k) is proportional to the fraction of molecules with sufficient energy, which is given by the Arrhenius factor e⁻Ea/RT.

A lower activation energy means a larger fraction of molecules can overcome the energy barrier, leading to a faster reaction rate.

The units of k depend on the overall order of the reaction (e.g., s⁻¹ for first order, L mol⁻¹ s⁻¹ for second order). Therefore, A has different units for reactions of different orders.

The reason is also TRUE. Nuclei with odd numbers of both protons and neutrons are generally less stable than their even-even neighbors. However, the primary reason for the exceptional stability of Ca-40 is its doubly magic nature, which is a more specific and powerful concept than the general odd-odd rule.

To achieve stability, nuclei with a high n/p ratio convert a neutron into a proton via beta decay (n → p + e⁻). The high n/p ratio is the direct cause for this mode of decay.

Radioactive decay is a nuclear phenomenon, and its rate constant (λ) is independent of external chemical and physical conditions like temperature and pressure.

    "solution": "1. Find Half-life: For a zero-order reaction, the completion time (T) is twice the half-life (t₁/₂). T = 2 * t₁/₂.\n   Given T = 13.86 min, the half-life for the zero-order reaction is t₁/₂ = 13.86 / 2 = 6.93 min.\n2. Relate Half-lives: The problem states the half-lives are equal. So, the half-life for the first-order reaction is also t₁/₂ = 6.93 min.\n3. Calculate Rate Constant (k): For a first-order reaction, k = 0.693 / t₁/₂.\n   k = 0.693 / 6.93 min = 0.1 min⁻¹.\n4. Convert to hr⁻¹: k = 0.1 min⁻¹ * (60 min / 1 hr) = 6 hr⁻¹."

    "question": "For any acid catalysed reaction, A --(H+)--> B. Half-life period is independent of concentration of A at given pH. At same concentration of A half-life time is 10min at pH = 2 and half-life time is 100min at pH = 3. If the rate law expression of reaction is r = k[A]ˣ[H⁺]ʸ then calculate the value of (x + y).",
    "solution": "1. Determine Order w.r.t. A (x): The statement 'Half-life period is independent of concentration of A' is the defining characteristic of a first-order reaction. Therefore, x = 1.\n2. Determine Order w.r.t. H⁺ (y): The rate law for this pseudo-order reaction can be written as Rate = k_obs[A], where the observed rate constant k_obs = k[H⁺]ʸ. The half-life is t₁/₂ = 0.693 / k_obs. This means t₁/₂ is inversely proportional to k_obs, and thus t₁/₂ ∝ 1 / [H⁺]ʸ.\n3. Use the given data to find y:\n   - At pH=2, t₁=10 min and [H⁺]₁ = 10⁻² M.\n   - At pH=3, t₂=100 min and [H⁺]₂ = 10⁻³ M.\n   Using ratios: (t₁ / t₂) = ([H⁺]₂ / [H⁺]₁)ʸ\n   (10 / 100) = (10⁻³ / 10⁻²)ʸ\n   1/10 = (1/10)ʸ\n   Therefore, y = 1.\n4.

    "question": "For a reaction, A ⇌ B equilibrium constant is 1.66 and k_forward = 0.166 hr⁻¹. Calculate the time (in hours) when concentration of B is 80% of its equilibrium concentration. (Given: ln 25 = 3.20)",
    "solution": "1. Calculate k_backward (kᵣ): The equilibrium constant K_eq = k_forward / k_reverse.\n   1.66 = 0.166 / kᵣ  =>  kᵣ = 0.166 / 1.66 = 0.1 hr⁻¹.\n2. Use the Integrated Rate Law for Reversible Reactions: For a reaction A ⇌ B, the time is given by t = [1 / (k_f + kᵣ)] * ln[xₑ / (xₑ - x)], where x is the concentration of B at time t, and xₑ is the equilibrium concentration of B.\n3. Apply the Condition: We need the time for x = 0.80 * xₑ.\n   t = [1 / (0.166 + 0.1)] * ln[xₑ / (xₑ - 0.8xₑ)]\n   t = [1 / 0.266] * ln[xₑ / 0.2xₑ] = (1 / 0.266) * ln(5).\n4. Calculate ln(5): From the hint, ln(25) = 3.20. Since ln(25) = ln(5²) = 2ln(5), we have 2ln(5) = 3.20, which means ln(5) = 1.60.\n5. Final Calculation: t = 1.60 / 0.266 ≈ 6.015 hours. The time is approximately 6 hours."

Overall half life of the reaction is 15 days then calculate the number of mole of C after 45 days in terms of 10⁻² if the ratio of k₁:k₂:k₃ is 2:2:3. (Note: This question is poorly worded and contains conflicting information. A plausible interpretation assuming k₁ is for a third parallel path A→B is presented.)",
    "solution": "Assuming the reaction is A → B (k₁), A → C (k₂), A → D (k₃) and the product stoichiometry from the text is a separate piece of information.\n1. Overall Decay Constant (λ_total): λ_total = k₁ + k₂ + k₃. Given overall t₁/₂ = 15 days, λ_total = 0.693 / 15 days⁻¹.\n2. Ratio of Rate Constants: k₁:k₂:k₃ = 2:2:3. Let k₁=2k, k₂=2k, k₃=3k. Then λ_total = 2k+2k+3k = 7k. So, 7k = 0.693/15.\n3. Moles Reacted: Time t = 45 days. This is 45/15 = 3 half-lives. Starting with N₀=1 mole of A, the amount reacted is N₀ * (1 - (1/2)³) = 1 * (1 - 1/8) = 7/8 moles.\n4. Moles Forming C: The fraction of A that reacts to form C is k₂ / λ_total = 2k / 7k = 2/7.\n5. Amount of A reacted to form C = (Total A reacted) * (fraction for C) = (7/8) * (2/7) = 2/8 = 1/4 = 0.25 moles.\n6. Amount of C formed: The reaction is A → 8C. So, moles of C = 8 * (moles of A reacted to form C) = 8 * 0.25 = 2 moles.\n(Note: This logical derivation yields 2 moles. The provided answer key states '1', which cannot be derived. The question is likely flawed.)"

    "solution": "1. Relate Decay Stages to Fraction Remaining:\n   - 33.33% decay means 1 - 1/3 = 2/3 of the substance remains. Let this be N₁.\n   - 66.66% decay means 1 - 2/3 = 1/3 of the substance remains. Let this be N₂.\n2. Time Interval: The time interval between these two stages is the time it takes for the amount of substance to decrease from N₁ to N₂. The ratio N₂/N₁ = (1/3) / (2/3) = 1/2. The time required for the amount of a radioactive substance to halve is, by definition, one half-life (t₁/₂).\n3.

    "solution": "1. Analyze Decay Types:\n   - Isodiaphers have the same neutron excess (N-P). α-decay (loss of 2p, 2n) maintains N-P constant.

    "solution": "1. Determine Overall Decay: We first find the number of α and β particles in the total decay.\n   - Number of α particles = (Mass change) / 4 = (232 - 208) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6.\n   - Number of β particles = (Final Z) - (Initial Z - 2*#α) = 82 - (90 - 2*6) = 82 - (90 - 12) = 82 - 78 = 4.\n2. Interpret 'n': The term 'number of isobars formed' is ambiguous. Following the hint from the solutions page, it seems to interpret 'n' as the number of beta decay steps plus one (for the initial family), effectively counting the number of distinct mass numbers that undergo beta decay. In the Thorium series, the mass numbers that have beta emitters are 228 and 212. This doesn't lead to n=5. The hint's value of n=5 is likely based on a non-standard or specific definition for this problem set. \n3. Use Hint to Solve: Assuming the intended value from the problem source's logic is n=5, the calculation is:\n   n + 2 = 5 + 2 = 7."
