    "Answers": "The equation of the motion projected on the x axis is\nx = A‚Çì sin œât.\nIn the case where the object moves clockwise, the deflection along the y axis at time zero (t = 0) is y = A·µß, and then it decreases to zero when the maximum on the x axis is attained.

For this reason the complete Lissajous figure touches the sides of the rectangle limiting the motion exactly the same number of times as there are periods in the motion of the point in a certain direction.

    "Answers": "The kinetic energy is maximal when the velocity is maximal in absolute value. Being the time derivative of displacement, the velocity is maximal at moment 2. The maximal potential energy is determined by the maximal displacement, that is, the amplitude, and is equal to kA¬≤/2. Hence, it is maximal at moment 1. At this moment the kinetic energy is zero, while the potential energy is zero at moment 2.

    "Answers": "The period of harmonic oscillations that take place due to a quasielastic force (F = -kx) is determined from the formula\nœÑ = 2œÄ‚àö(m/k). (6.10.1)\nThe spring constant k is defined as the force that is required to stretch the spring in such a manner that the spring elongation becomes equal to its initial length. In the case at hand the elongations occur because of the weight of the loads, with the result that\nk‚ÇÅ = m‚ÇÅg/l and k‚ÇÇ = m‚ÇÇg/l.\nSubstituting k into (6.10.1), we see that the masses cancel out and in both cases the period is\nœÑ = 2œÄ‚àö(l/g).\nThe same result can be obtained (to within a constant coefficient) from dimensional reasoning. There are three quantities that appear in the problem: mass, elongation, and time (the sought period). In addition, since forces equal to the weights of the loads are applied to the springs, we may assume that the acceleration of gravity g will enter into the solution.

    "Answers": "Initially the velocity of the pendulum is zero and tends to zero as the pendulum approaches its position of equilibrium, so that it first grows and then, after passing through its maximum, decreases. We can arrive at the same conclusion after analyzing qualitatively the differential equation of the motion of the pendulum written in polar coordinates in the common approximation of small deflections:\nIŒ±Ãà = -gŒ± - rŒ±Ãá.\nWe select a system of coordinates in which the positive direction is the one in which the pendulum was initially deflected from the point of equilibrium. Initially, when the velocity was zero and the deflection was the largest, the acceleration was the highest. The curve depicting the time dependence of the deflection has at this point the greatest curvature. In the process of motion, the first term on the right-hand side of the equation decreases in numerical value, while the second term (which is positive since Œ±Ãá < 0) grows, and because of this the absolute value of the acceleration decreases. There finally comes a moment when the acceleration vanishes and the velocity reaches its maximum.

Why is this situation meaningless not only from the physical standpoint but also from the mathematical standpoint? How does a system oscillate in a medium that has practically no resistance?",
    "Answers": "The differential equation describing the behavior of the system is\nm·∫ç + r·∫ã + kx = F‚ÇÄ sin œât, (6.28.1)\nand it has two solutions, a steady-state and a transient. The latter describes the process of setting in of forced oscillations. Usually only the steady-state solution is considered. However, at r = 0 and œâ = œâ‚ÇÄ this equation has no steady-state solution, and because of this the amplitude continuously increases and so does the energy of the system, which energy is taken from the source of oscillations. In reality, a system in which the resistance of the medium is negligible for all practical purposes either behaves in such a manner that the amplitude reaches values at which Hooke's law ceases to be valid (and, respectively, Eq.

    "Answers": "The resonance frequency is the same for both oscillations:\nœâ·µ£‚Çë‚Çõ = ‚àö(œâ‚ÇÄ¬≤ - 2Œ≤¬≤).\nSince the natural frequencies also coincide, so do the damping factors Œ≤. The resonance amplitude is\nA·µ£‚Çë‚Çõ = F‚ÇÄ / (2Œ≤m‚àö(œâ‚ÇÄ¬≤-Œ≤¬≤)).\nOnly two quantities in this formula can vary: the mass of the oscillating object and the amplitude of the driving force.

An aperture whose width is much smaller than the wavelength limits a section of the wavefront (a line in the present case) that can be considered as a point source.

    "Answers": "Since the frequency of the oscillations remains constant, the energy carried by the wave is determined uniquely by the amplitude, that is, is proportional to the square of the amplitude. The amplitude at a crest A‚ÇÅ is equal to the sum of the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves, A‚ÇÅ and A‚ÇÇ, while the amplitude at a node, A‚Çô, is equal to the difference between A‚ÇÅ and A‚ÇÇ:\nA‚ÇÅ = A‚ÇÅ + A‚ÇÇ, A‚Çô = A‚ÇÅ - A‚ÇÇ.\nHence, the amplitudes of the incident and reflected waves are\nA‚ÇÅ = (A‚ÇÅ+A‚Çô)/2, A‚ÇÇ = (A‚ÇÅ-A‚Çô)/2.\nHence,\nA‚ÇÇ/A‚ÇÅ = (A‚ÇÅ-A‚Çô)/(A‚ÇÅ+A‚Çô) = (A‚ÇÅ/A‚Çô-1)/(A‚ÇÅ/A‚Çô+1) = (Œ¥-1)/(Œ¥+1).\nThe ratio of the energy of the reflected wave to that of the incident wave is equal to the ratio of the squares of the amplitudes:\nW‚ÇÇ/W‚ÇÅ = ((Œ¥-1)/(Œ¥+1))¬≤.\nHence, the ratio of the energy that has passed the obstacle to the energy of the waves incident on the obstacle is\nW‚Çê/W‚ÇÅ = 1 - ((Œ¥-1)/(Œ¥+1))¬≤ = 4Œ¥ / (Œ¥+1)¬≤.\nWhen the amplitudes are equal (Œ¥ = 1) no standing waves are formed and the entire energy passes the obstacle. In the theory and practice of propagation of waves (say, electromagnetic waves) a common notion is that of the standing-wave ratio, which is the ratio of the energies (or squares of amplitudes) at crest and node.

    "Answers": "According to formula (6.33.2), the speed of sound in a gas is proportional to the square root of Œ≥ and inversely proportional to the molecular mass. At a fixed temperature the difference in speeds of sound is determined by the ratio ‚àö(Œ≥/M). For water vapor (six degrees of freedom) Œ≥ = 1.33 and for neon (three degrees of freedom) Œ≥ = 1.67. The molecular mass of water is 1.8 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤ kg/mol and that of neon is 2.02 √ó 10‚Åª¬≤ kg/mol. The ratios Œ≥/M is 74.1 for water vapor and 82.5 for neon.\nThus, the upper straight line depicts the temperature dependence of the speed of sound in neon and the lower one depicts the temperature dependence of the speed of sound in water vapor.

When the receiver is in motion, its velocity with respect to the waves is\nc = c‚ÇÄ ¬± v.\nHere the plus corresponds to motion against the waves, while the minus corresponds to motion in the same direction as the waves propagate.

As Snell's law shows, this happens when the speed of sound increases with altitude.
