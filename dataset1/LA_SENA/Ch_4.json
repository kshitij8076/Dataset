    "Questions": "Two conductors, 1-3-5 and 2-4-6, connected points with equal potentials on the resistors R_a and R_b, so that no current flows through either of them. Will there be currents flowing through them and through the 3-4 section if the key K is closed? Will this lead to a change in the reading of the ammeter?",
    "Answers": "The two conductors, 1-3-5 and 2-4-6, have different potentials, with the result that when key K is closed, a current will flow from 3 to 4, while the currents passing through the resistors will flow from 1 to 3, from 5 to 3, from 4 to 6, and from 4 to 2. The closing of the key leads to an increase in the current flowing through the ammeter. If the resistances of the conductors 1-3-5, 2-4-6, and 3-4 are extremely low, then the sections 1-2 and 5-6 of the resistors will be shorted for all practical purposes."

    "Answers": "Prior to closing the key, the circuit consists of two resistors connected in parallel (the resistance of each resistor being 3R). This means that the total resistance of the circuit is 1.5R. After the key has been closed, the circuit consists of two sections connected in series, each of which has two resistors connected in parallel. The resistance R' of each section is given by the formula\n1/R' = 1/R + 1/(2R)\nand is equal to 2R/3. The resistance of the entire circuit is 4R/3. The current measured by the ammeter is higher than that measured prior to closing the key."

A voltmeter V is connected between the sliding contact and one fixed end of the potentiometer. It is assumed that the resistance of the voltmeter is not very high if compared with the resistance of the potentiometer. What voltage will the voltmeter show: higher than, less than, or equal to U₀/2?",
    "Answers": "If R is the resistance of the whole potentiometer and R_v is the resistance of the voltmeter, the total resistance of section ab of the potentiometer is\nR_ab = (R_v(R/2))/(R_v+R/2) = R/(2(1+R/2R_v)) < R/2.\nThe resistance of section bc is equal to R/2. The voltage applied to the potentiometer will not be distributed evenly. Since the resistance of ab is less than that of bc, the voltage applied to the first section is lower than that applied to the second. The higher the resistance of the voltmeter, the closer the readings of the voltmeter are to one-half of the applied voltage."

    "Questions": "A 'black box' is an electric unit with four terminals, 1, 2, 3, and 4, and an unknown internal structure. The box shown in Figure (a) and (b) possesses the following properties: if a constant voltage of 220 V is applied to terminals 1 and 2, a voltage of 127 V appears across terminals 3 and 4 (Figure (a)), while if a voltage of 127 V is applied to terminals 3 and 4, the same voltage of 127 V appears across terminals 1 and 2 (Figure (b)). What is inside the 'black box'? The formulation of the problem is quite meaningful if the voltages are measured by electrostatic voltmeters, which do not consume electric current. If voltmeters of the magnetoelectric, thermal, or electromagnetic type are employed, the voltages across the 'out' terminals of the 'black box' may somewhat differ from the ones indicated in Figures (a) and (b).",
    "Answers": "Since the voltage applied to the 'black box' is supplied by a DC source, it is natural to assume that there are only resistances inside the 'box'. The simplest way to lower voltage is to use a potentiometer (see the figure accompanying the answer). However, there is not a single circuit employing only resistances that can raise voltage. As the figure accompanying the answer demonstrates, from the voltage applied to terminals 1 and 2 one can always 'take' a certain fraction, e.g. 127 V, while the 127 V applied to terminals 3 and 4 will yield the same 127 V on terminals 1 and 2. The remark (made in the problem) that concerns the role of the measuring device is important since a voltmeter, which always has a finite resistance, redistributes the resistances in the circuit and, hence, changes the voltages (see Problem 4.3)."

How will the reading of the ammeter vary as the sliding contact of the second potentiometer is moved from one end of the potentiometer to the other?",
    "Answers": "Let us assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the resistances of the two potentiometers are the same. When the sliding contact of each potentiometer is in the middle, the total resistance of the circuit is R₀/2, where R₀ is the resistance of each potentiometer. If the sliding contact of the second potentiometer is in the extreme (left or right) position, we have two resistances, R₀ and R₀/2, connected in parallel (assuming that the wires have no resistance), so that the total resistance is R = R₀/3. The reading of the ammeter proves to be greater than when the sliding contact of the second potentiometer was in the middle position by a factor of 1.5. Thus, when the sliding contact of the second potentiometer is moved from one extreme position to the other, the readings of the ammeter pass through a minimum."

    "Answers": "If x is the resistance of the potentiometer between point a and the sliding contact, the total resistance between a and the sliding contact is rx/(r+x), while the resistance of the entire circuit is R - x + rx/(r+x). The current supplied by the DC source is\nI = U₀ / (R - x + rx/(r+x)).\nThe potential difference between the sliding contact and point a is\nU = (U₀rx)/((R-x)(r+x)+rx) = U₀rx/(Rx - x² + Rr).\nThe current passing through the ammeter is\nI_a = U₀r/(Rx - x² + Rr). (4.6.1)\nTo find the extremum, we take the derivative\ndI_a/dx = U₀r[(-R+2x)/(Rx-x²+rx)²]. (4.6.2)\nNullifying (4.6.2) yields\nx = R/2. (4.6.3)\nIf we substitute (4.6.3) into (4.6.1) we find the minimal current:\nI_min = U₀r/(R(r+R/4)).\nThus, as the sliding contact is moved, the current through the ammeter passes through a minimum, and the smaller the r the deeper the minimum. At x = 0 and x = R, a current of I_max = U₀/R passes through the ammeter. The ratio of I_min to I_max is equal to (r/R)(1 + r/R)⁻¹.

This can be achieved by selecting a proper ratio of resistances between points a and b and points b and c using the resistance box.

    "Answers": "The current is maximal when the circuit is shorted, or when the external resistance is zero:\nI_m = ε/r.\nThus, in both cases the ratio of the emf to the internal resistance is the same. Maximal useful power output (the power output of the external resistance) is achieved when the external resistance is made equal to the internal resistance (see the answer to Problem 4.11), that is, when the current is one-half the maximal current. This power output is\nP = ε²/(4R) = ε²/4r.\nSince the ratio ε/r is the same in both cases, a double useful power output is achieved at a double electromotive force (for equal currents).

    "Answers": "The likely circuit, apparently, consists of a combination of cells connected in parallel and in series. There are two possibilities here: several parallel groups of cells connected in series or several in-series groups of cells connected in parallel. First, it can be shown that the two variants are equivalent. Indeed, in the first variant, the potentials at the points a₁, a₂, a₃, etc. coincide, i.e.\nU_a₁ = U_a₂ = U_a₃ = ...;\nthe same is true of the potentials at the points b₁, b₂, b₃, etc., i.e.\nU_b₁ = U_b₂ = U_b₃ = ...\nThis line of reasoning can be continued. The respective points can be interconnected, and the entire circuit will be transformed into the second variant. Suppose the overall number of cells is N. We connect these cells in such a manner that groups of n cells that form m = N/n parallel groups are connected in series. In this case the current in the external circuit is\nI = mε/(R+rn/m) = Nnε/(RN+rn²).\nThe power output in the external circuit is\nP = I²R = (Nnε)²R/(RN+rn²)².\nTo find the maximal value, we nullify the derivative of P with respect to n:\ndP/dn = 2ε²N²n/(RN+rn²)² (RN-rn²) = 0.\nWhence\nn = √(RN/r). (4.14.1)\nBut this does not solve the problem completely. The number n should be one of the cofactors of N. To find a practical value of n, we must compare the power outputs for two values of n that are closest to the one given by (4.14.1), that is, one must be smaller than the calculated value and the other must be greater, and yet the two must be cofactors of N. Here is an example. Suppose N = 400, R = 16 Ω and r = 9 Ω. The calculated value is\nn = √(400x16/9) = 26.7.\nThe closest cofactors of N are 25 and 40. In this example the greater power output is at n = 25. Thus, the circuit consists of 16 parallel groups of 25 cells connected in series in each group."

    "Questions": "Can a circuit be constructed in which the displacement current in the capacitor remains practically constant over a definite time interval?",
    "Answers": "Since the displacement current is defined as\nI_dis = S(dD/dt),\nafter performing certain manipulations we can write\nI_dis = (ε₀ε/l)(dU/dt) = dQ/dt,\nwhere Q is the charge on the capacitor. Thus, the displacement current may be made constant over a definite time interval if the capacitor is charged (or discharged) by a direct current. For this in the circuit of the capacitor being charged we must have a device that restricts the current flowing through it within broad voltage limits (Figure (a)). A diode operating in the saturation mode may serve as such a device. For the case of a thermionic valve (or diode) the appropriate circuit is shown in Figure (b), while for the case of a semiconductor diode the circuit is shown in Figure (c). The diode is introduced into the circuit in the cut-off direction, and the voltage across the diode is\nU_d = ε₀ - U_c.\nAs long as U_d remains within the saturation region, the current through the diode (and, hence, the charging current) remains constant. The displacement current remains constant in the process. After a certain time interval has elapsed (the lower the charging current the longer the interval), the charging current rapidly falls off to zero. The time dependence of the displacement current is illustrated schematically in Figure (d)."

In addition, there is always a magnetic field around a conductor with current, and this magnetic field carries energy, just as an electric field does. If the resistance of the conductors is low (zero in the case of superconductors), the difference between the initial and the final energy will go to the magnetic field. Eventually the second capacitor will become fully charged while the first capacitor will become completely discharged and the current will cease.

    "Answers": "The heating of the conductor will result in the electron diffusing into the neighborhood of section ab, with the potential of the conductor somewhat increasing. The current flowing in the conductor will have to overcome a potential barrier at point a. This requires additional energy, which will be taken from the metal. On the other hand, when passing through the conductor at point b, the current goes to a region with a lower potential, and in this place energy will be released to the metal. As a result, the point where the temperature is at a maximum will shift in the direction of current flow."

    "Questions": "A constant voltage is applied to a metal wire. The current passing through the wire heats the wire to a certain temperature. Then half of the wire is cooled by a stream of air from a fan. How will the temperature of the other half of the wire change in the process?",
    "Answers": "Prior to cooling, the resistance of the wire was the same over the entire length of the wire (precisely, the resistivity was the same at all points of the wire). When the fan is switched on, the resistance of the section that is being cooled will lower. This leads to a redistribution of the potential between the cooled and uncooled sections, with the greater voltage applied to the latter section, as a result of which its temperature increases. This phenomenon is enhanced by the fact that the resistance of the uncooled section somewhat grows with temperature, which leads to a still greater inhomogeneity in the distribution of the potential in both sections."

    "Answers": "The resistances of bulbs with the same rated voltage are in inverse proportion to the rated wattages. Hence, the resistance of the bulb with the lower wattage is six times the resistance of the bulb with the higher wattage. When the bulbs are connected in series with the DC source, the current is the same and six-sevenths of the total voltage of 220 V, or 189 V, is applied to the first (25 W) bulb and one-seventh, to the second (150 W) bulb. Actually the difference is still greater because the resistance of the first bulb will increase due to overheating, while that of the second will decrease. Hence, the 25-W bulb must burn out."

    "Answers": "An increase in voltage will lead to an increase in the currents passing through the conductor and semiconductor, and this will lead to an increase in temperature of both. As a result the resistance of the conductor will increase and that of the semiconductor will decrease. Hence, the current through the semiconductor will increase greater than in proportion to the voltage, while the current through the conductor will increase lesser than in proportion to the applied voltage, with the result that the ammeter in the semiconductor circuit will register a higher current than the ammeter in the conductor circuit."

When the voltage is increased, the current in the circuit increases, too, and so does the temperatures of the semiconductor and conductor.

    "Questions": "A thermionic valve, or diode, has a heated filament and a plate near it. The dependence of the current flowing between filament and plate on the voltage applied to valve (the current-voltage characteristic) is as follows. First the current grows with voltage, but then goes into a plateau at a sufficiently high voltage. Why, notwithstanding the fact that the filament may emit the number of electrons required for the saturation current to set in, the latter does not manifest itself at an arbitrarily small voltage between the electrodes? In which respect does curve 1 differ from curve 2 from the standpoint of the experimental conditions if the two are obtained using the same device?",
    "Answers": "The electrons leaving the filament, or cathode, create a negative space charge whose field does not let all the emitted electrons into the region. According to the Child-Langmuir theory developed for parallel plane electrodes on the assumption that the initial velocity of the electrons is zero, the current density between the electrodes is\nj = (4√2ε₀/9)√(e/m) * U³/²/d²\n(the three-halves power law). Here e and m are the electron charge and electron mass, U is the voltage drop across the electrodes, and d is the distance between the electrodes. On the current-voltage characteristic, the initial segment of the curve agrees with the three-halves power law. Then, as the electron cloud is dissipated, the current gradually reaches a plateau and saturation sets in, with the saturation current being the total flux of electrons that the cathode can deliver at a given temperature. The temperature dependence of the current density is given by the Richardson-Dushman equation\nj_sat = A'T²exp(-P/kT).\nThe quantity P in the numerator of the exponent is the so-called work function, or the work that an electron must do to leave the metal. The other quantities in the equation are as follows: T the thermodynamic temperature, k the Boltzmann constant, A' = 6.02 x 10⁵ A/m²·K² is a constant that is a combination of universal constants.

    "Answers": "When thermoelectric current flows from the cathode to the anode, the electrons leaving the cathode carry away an energy required for overcoming the potential barrier that exists at the metal-vacuum interface (the work function of the electrons), with the result that the cathode cools off.

Why, notwithstanding the fact that the electrodes are flat and the distance between them is much smaller than their linear dimensions, is the field between the electrodes nonuniform?",
    "Answers": "When the potential difference between the electrodes is nil, the concentration of positive and negative ions (cations and anions) is the same in practically the entire volume. When an external voltage is applied, a current generated by the motions of cations to the cathode and anions to the anode begins to flow in the electrolyte. As a result, the regions near the electrodes prove to be depleted of ions whose sign is that of the electrode. Cations leave the anode and anions leave the cathode. For this reason, near the anode an excess of negative charge is formed, while an excess of positive charge is formed in the region near the cathode. All this leads to a distortion in the electric field. The enhanced field near the electrodes imparts an enhanced velocity to the ions. This ensures the flow of current under lower charge carrier concentrations."

Hence, the entire region between the cathode and the anode is divided, within the first approximation (i.e. ignoring certain details), into the cathode space (from point 0 to point 1 in the figure accompanying the problem) with a surplus positive charge, the Faraday dark space (from point 1 to point 2) with a negative charge, and the region of the 'positive column' (from point 2 to point 3), which constitutes a plasma with practically equal concentrations of electrons and positive ions and, hence, with a net charge that is practically nil.\n* See Problems 3.28 and 3.29."

Will an ammeter connected in series with the gas discharge gap show the sum of the electron and ion currents or their difference?",
    "Answers": "The conduction-current density is given by the formula\nj = Σ_k n_k u_k Z_k, (4.33.1)\nwhere e is the magnitude (without taking into account the sign) of the elementary charge (the electron charge), n_k the concentration of the given type of charge carriers, u_k the average directional velocity of the carriers, and Z_k the charge number, or valence, of the carriers. For an electron Z = -1, while for a positive doubly charged ion (say, He++) Z = +2. Electron velocities exceed ion velocities by a factor of 10 or even 100, with the result that even at equal concentrations the electron current is much stronger than the ion current. Since in an electric field electrons and ions move in opposite directions, we can assume that the electron velocity is negative if the ion velocity is set positive. Since the number Z for electrons is negative, the signs of the products in (4.33.1) coincide, with the result that the ammeter in the gas discharge gap circuit will register the total current of electrons and ions."

    "Questions": "A negatively charged particle is accelerated in its motion from a cathode C to an anode A, passes through an aperture in the latter, and moves toward a Faraday cylinder F that is at the same potential as the anode (Figure (a)). For the sake of simplicity it will be assumed that the particle moves from A to F with a constant velocity. Determine the moment of time when a measuring device G in the circuit will register a current (the time is reckoned from the moment when the particle leaves the anode) and the form of the current, that is, whether the current is in the form of a pulse when the particle leaves the anode (Figure (b)) or whether it is a pulse when the particle enters the Faraday cylinder (Figure (c)) or whether there are two pulses (one when the particle leaves the anode and the other when the particle enters the Faraday cylinder; see Figure (d)) or whether the current is steady over the entire motion of the particle from the anode to the Faraday cylinder (Figure (e)).",
    "Answers": "As the particle moves from the anode to the Faraday cylinder, the field in the region between A and F constantly changes. When the particle leaves the anode (through the aperture) and is moving toward the Faraday cylinder, it induces positive charges on these electrodes, and the magnitude of these charges constantly changes. The density of these charges on the anode decreases while that on the Faraday cylinder increases (the variation in the distribution of electric charge for three moments in time is shown in the figure accompanying the answer). For this reason, in the region of space between A and F there appears a continuous displacement current, which means that an exact replica of this current appears in the circuit. The current in the circuit can be graphically represented as a consequence of the fact that in approaching the Faraday cylinder the particle repels, so to say, the electrons which, in effect, move toward the anode through the measuring device G. Thus, the current in the circuit exists during the entire time of motion of the particle between the anode and the Faraday cylinder, as shown in Figure (e) accompanying the problem."

If the metals are brought into contact, what will be the values of the internal and external contact potential differences? In which metal will the electron concentration be higher?",
    "Answers": "When two metals are brought into contact, the Fermi level is the same for both. The difference between the two work functions (for the two barriers) is equal to the external contact potential difference. To transfer an electron from the surface of metal 2 to the surface of metal 1 requires performing an amount of work equal to eΔφ. The distance between the levels of minimal electron energy in the metals determines the internal contact potential difference ΔW_F. According to the quantum theory of metals, the Fermi level at 0 K is pinned at (h²/2m) x (3n/π)²/³, where h is the Planck constant, m the electron mass, and n the electron concentration in a metal.

    "Answers": "The diffusion of electrons from an n-type semiconductor into a p-type one and of holes from the p-type semiconductor to the n-type one leads to the appearance of a positive potential on the n-type semiconductor (the left branch of curve 0) and a negative potential on the p-type semiconductor (the right branch of the same curve). If we now apply a positive potential to the n-type semiconductor and a negative potential to the p-type, the potential difference between the two semiconductors will increase (curve 1), whence the boundary between the two semiconductors is depleted of charge carries as a result of electrons being drained to the n-type semiconductor and holes, to the p-type. Such a direction of the potential difference is the cut-off one. When the external voltage is applied in the reverse direction (curve 2), the potential difference lowers, and it proves easier for the electrons to move to the p-type semiconductor and the holes, to the n-type.

What is the explanation for the existence of the left branch and in what manner does the current in the blocking direction depend on the temperature of the diode?",
    "Answers": "Every semiconductor possesses intrinsic conduction in addition to extrinsic (or impurity) conduction. Intrinsic conduction is caused by the transfer of electrons from the valence band to the conduction band and by simultaneous formation of holes in the valence band. Intrinsic conduction is of a mixed nature for this reason, and because of this the n-type semiconductor carries a small number of holes while the p-type semiconductor carries a small number of electrons. When a voltage is applied in the cut-off direction, these charge carriers constitute the so-called reverse current. As the temperature of a semiconductor diode is increased, the electron and hole concentrations grow, as a result of which conductivity in the cut-off direction grows, too. The reverse current reaches a plateau when practically all the 'alien' charge carriers (holes in the n-type semiconductor and electrons in the p-type) participate. Usually this current is several orders of magnitude less than the direct current, with the plateau reached at relatively high voltages. The direct current grows with voltage very rapidly, since as the voltage is increased, it becomes easier for the charge carriers to pass through the junction."

    "Questions": "The phenomenon of secondary electron emission consists in the following. When electrons bombard a solid surface, the surface emits secondary electrons (and partially reflects the primary electrons, which impinge on the surface). Secondary electron emission is characterized by the secondary emission coefficient σ, which is the ratio of the secondary electron current to the primary current. The dependence of the secondary emission coefficient on the primary electron energy W₁ for a certain dielectric is depicted in the figure. At σ = 1 the surface of the dielectric does not change its potential under electron bombardment, since the number of electrons leaving the surface every second is equal in this case to the number of electrons bombarding the surface every second. The two points a and b on the σ vs. W₁ curve correspond to σ = 1. At which point is the process stable and at which is it unstable?",
    "Answers": "Let us suppose that there is a small deviation from the state with σ = 1. If σ drops at point a, the number of electrons impinging on the surface is smaller than the number of electrons leaving the surface, with the surface acquiring a negative potential, which brings down σ still further. And this leads to a further increase in the negative potential. The process continues until the current of primary electrons becomes totally cut off. If at the same point the value of σ increases somewhat, the surface acquires a positive potential, the velocity of the electrons increases, and the current continues to grow, which leads to an increase in σ, up to the maximum on the curve, and then to point b, where σ = 1, just as at point a. Similar reasoning leads us to the conclusion that small variations in σ at point b change the potential of the surface in such a way that σ returns to its initial value σ = 1. Thus, point a corresponds to an unstable state, while point b corresponds to a stable state. For a small deviation from the state of equilibrium corresponding to point a, the surface acquires a potential that either completely cuts off the current of the primary electrons or corresponds to that at point b."
