    "Questions": "Two balloons of the same volume are filled with gases at the same pressure, one with hydrogen and the other with helium. Which of the two has the greater buoyancy (including the weight of the bag) and what is the ratio of buoyancies?",
    "Answers": "The buoyancy, or lifting power, is the difference between the weight of the air in the volume occupied by the balloon and the weight of the gas filling the balloon. According to the ideal-gas law, the latter weight is\nP = (pVM/RT)g,\nwhere V is the volume of the balloon, p the pressure of the gas, and M the molecular mass of the gas. Accordingly, the lifting power is given by the formula\nF = (pVg/RT)(M_air - M_gas), (2.1.1)\nand the buoyancy ratio is\nF_H₂/F_He = (M_air - M_H₂)/(M_air - M_He).\nInto Eq. (2.1.1) we can substitute the relative molecular masses. The relative molecular mass of hydrogen is 2, that of helium is 4, and that of air we assume to be equal to 29. Thus,\nF_H₂/F_He = (29-2)/(29-4) = 1.08."

    "Answers": "Since the velocities of the molecules are different, it takes the molecules different times to fly from the slit to the outer cylinder.

Will the distribution curve constructed in this manner be valid for different gases, different number of molecules, and different temperatures or will it be necessary to reconstruct the curve anew for each case?",

Let us also assume that, in accordance with the ideal gas model, there are no collisions between the molecules. How would the kinetic energy of molecules vary with altitude under such conditions? Up to what altitude would an atmosphere consisting of nitrogen and oxygen extend?",
    "Answers": "By hypothesis, w_kino = (3/2)kT. Substituting k = R/N_A and m = M/N_A, we get\nh = 3RT/2Mg.\nSubstituting the values of the molecular masses, we find that at T = 300 K the maximum altitude for nitrogen is 13.6 km, for oxygen 11.9 km, and for hydrogen 191 km. Since the kinetic energy of the molecules decreases as the altitude grows, the 'temperature' of a gas decreases, too, but differently for different gases. Different gases have different 'temperatures' at the same altitude above sea level. At the highest level where the molecules of a given gas can still be found, the 'temperature' of the gas is 0 K. Note, in conclusion, that by its very meaning the barometric formula, which is derived on the assumption that the temperature of the gas is constant, is equivalent to the statement that the Maxwellian velocity distribution is valid. Indeed, the barometric formula leads to Boltzmann's formula for the distribution of molecules in potential energy. The same formula can be obtained using the Maxwell formula."

    "Questions": "Here are two explanations of the buoyancy of a balloon filled with a light gas. According to the first, the buoyancy is simply the Archimedes' force equal to the weight of the air that would occupy the volume of the balloon (filled with the gas), while according to the second, the buoyancy is the difference between the barometric pressures acting on the upper and lower sections of the balloon. Do these explanations contradict each other?",
    "Answers": "To answer this question, we assume, for the sake of simplicity, that the balloon is a cylinder with its axis vertical and having a length h. If we denote by p₀ the pressure on the lower base of the balloon, then the pressure on the upper base is\np = p₀ exp(-Mgh/RT).\nSince Mgh/RT ≪ 1, we can expand the exponential and retain only the first two terms:\np = p₀(1 - Mgh/RT). (2.11.1)\nThe buoyancy is given by the formula\nF = S(p₀ - p),\nwhere S is the base area of the cylinder. Substituting the difference p₀ - p from (2.11.1), we get\nF = MghS/RT,\nor\nF = p₀MgV/RT.\nThe fraction p₀M/RT constitutes the density of air. p₀MV/RT the mass of the air that would occupy the volume of the balloon, and p₀MgV/RT the weight of this mass of air. Thus, the two explanations are equivalent."

Since the displacements are completely random both in length and direction, while the angle between two successive displacements is independent of the displacements, we conclude, first, that\n<l₁²> = <l₂²>\nand, second, that the third term is zero because all directions are equally probable. Thus,\n<l*²> = 2<l₁²> = 2<l²>.\nOne must bear in mind that we have averaged the squares of the displacements and not the displacements proper. However, since there is a constant relationship between the mean square and the square of the arithmetic mean for a definite distribution function, we can always replace the ratio of mean squares with the ratio of the squares of the mean,\n<l*>²/(2T) = <l>²/T\nand, hence,\n<l*> = √2 <l>."

Out of the N molecules that have covered the distance x without colliding, N(dx/λ) molecules experience collisions over segment x. Hence, the number of molecules that have traveled without colliding will change by\ndN = -N(dx/λ).\nIf N is the total number of molecules, then the number of molecules that have traveled a distance no less than x without colliding is determined through integration:\n∫(from N₀ to N) dN/N = -∫(from 0 to x) dx/λ,\nor\nln N = ln N₀ - x/λ.\nSince on the vertical axis we lay off base-10 logarithms, a and λ are linked in the following manner:\nλ = 2.3/a.\nModern electronics possesses a number of methods for determining the number of particles (molecules, atoms, ions, electrons) whose path exceeds a definite distance, which makes it possible to find the mean free path."

For this reason, at first the pressure in part 1 drops and in part 2 it rises. But then the rate of hydrogen diffusion lowers (since the amount of hydrogen in part 2 grows and the nitrogen continues to diffuse into part 1). As a result, the pressure in part 2 begins to drop and the pressure in part 1 begins to grow.

Which line corresponds to the case of an open vessel and which to the case of a closed vessel? The effective cross sections of the molecules are assumed to be constant.",
    "Answers": "The diffusion coefficient of the gas is\nD = (1/3)λv.\nIn the closed vessel, the mean free path remains constant* and the temperature dependence of the diffusion coefficient is determined only by the average velocity of the molecules, which is proportional to the square root of the temperature. The same relationship exists between the temperature and the diffusion coefficient:\nD ∝ T¹/².\nIn the open vessel, that is, at constant pressure, the concentration of molecules is inversely proportional to the temperature and, hence, the mean free path is proportional to the temperature. Therefore, for this case we have\nD ∝ T³/².\nOn the logarithmic scale the slope of a straight line is equal to the exponent in the power function. Hence, curve (a) (with the slope equal to 3/2) corresponds to the open vessel and curve (b) (with the slope equal to 1/2) corresponds to the closed vessel.\n* Here we have ignored the temperature dependence of the effective cross section (the Sutherland correction term)."

It may be assumed that the cross-sectional areas of the molecules of the two gases are the same. The relative molecular masses of both gases are also the same (equal to 28). Finally, the pressures in both parts are the same. After the partition is lifted, the gases begin to diffuse into each other. How does the amount of each gas that has transferred to the part occupied by the other gas depend on the initial pressures of the gases?",
    "Answers": "The diffusion rate, which characterizes the variation of the number dN of molecules passing through the cross-sectional area S of the vessel per unit time dt in the direction of the concentration gradient dn/dx, is\ndN/dt = -D(dn/dx)S.\nHere D = (1/3)λv is the diffusion coefficient. Since the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the pressure (because the mean free path is inversely proportional to the pressure) and the concentration gradient at each moment is proportional to the pressure, the number of molecules diffusing in this or that direction is pressure independent. This conclusion holds, of course, only if the mean free path of the molecules is many times smaller than the linear dimensions of the vessel.

The vessel is placed in a vacuum and has a small orifice through which the gas molecules escape into the vacuum. Is the average energy of the molecules leaving the vessel the same as that of the molecules remaining in the vessel? Is the velocity distribution for the molecules in both groups the same? The gas is assumed to be ideal, so that no Joule-Thomson effect is present.",
    "Answers": "The average kinetic energy of translational motion of molecules is (3/2)kT. The average energy of the molecules moving toward a wall of the vessel is 2kT. This is explained by the fact that the flux of molecules with a certain velocity is proportional to nv, where n_v is the concentration of the molecules having this velocity. Therefore, the higher the velocity, the greater the number of molecules moving in a given direction. Hence, in the velocity distribution of the molecules remaining in the vessel there appears a deficit of fast molecules, which leads to a decrease in the average energy of the molecules and a distortion in the distribution function. On the other hand, the average energy of the molecules leaving the vessel for the vacuum becomes higher than it was in the vessel. If the pressure of the gas is not low but the orifice is so small that no collisions occur in it, the average energy inside the vessel still decreases, if only this decrease is not compensated for by heat supplied to the walls of the vessel. Under these conditions, the Maxwellian velocity distribution is restored via the collisions of molecules in the vessel, but now this distribution corresponds to a lower temperature. The restoration of the distribution function occurs partially because molecules collide with the walls of the vessel."

    "Questions": "For temperatures close to room temperature and somewhat higher, the molar heat capacity of hydrogen agrees, with good accuracy, with the results predicted by the classical theory of heat capacity for ideal gases, a theory that allows for three translational and two rotational degrees of freedom for diatomic gases. However, at low temperatures the heat capacity of hydrogen drops and at about 40 K becomes the same as that of a monatomic gas. What is the explanation for this? Why such behavior is not observed in other diatomic gases?",
    "Answers": "The classical theory of heat capacity does not allow for the quantum nature of periodic motion (vibrational and rotational). According to quantum theory, the angular momentum of a rotating object may assume only values specified by the condition\nJω = ħ√j(j+1), (2.29.1)\nwhere ħ is the Dirac-Planck constant (the Planck constant h divided by 2π), J is the moment of inertia of the object, and j is the so-called rotational quantum number, which can take on any integral values starting from zero. Equation (2.29.1) enables finding the possible values of the rotational kinetic energy:\nW = Jω²/2 = (ħ²/2J)j(j+1).\nThe minimal nonzero value is\nW_m = ħ²/J.\nA molecule acquires and exchanges rotational energy through collisions with other molecules. Thus, the question of whether a molecule can have rotational energy in addition to translational is solved by comparing the value W_m of the minimal nonzero rotational energy with a quantity of the order of kT at room temperature. The separation of atoms in a hydrogen molecule is 0.74 nm and the mass of each atom is 1.67 x 10⁻²⁷ kg, so that the moment of inertia of a hydrogen molecule is 4.6 x 10⁻⁴⁸ kg·m². Bearing in mind that ħ = 1.05 x 10⁻³⁴ J·s, we get\nW_m = 2.4 x 10⁻²¹ J.\nAt room temperature (T ≈ 300 K),\nkT = 4.1 x 10⁻²¹ J.\nThe fact that kT somewhat exceeds W_m makes the occurrence of rotational motion in a molecule quite probable. Hence, the rotational degrees of freedom will contribute to the heat capacity of hydrogen. At temperatures of the order of 40 K the probability of rotational motion is practically nil; it is said that the rotational degrees of freedom 'freeze out' and only the translational degrees of freedom remain, which is reflected in the value of the heat capacity. The diatomic gas that is closest to hydrogen in the Periodic Table is nitrogen, and the mass of a nitrogen atom is fourteen times the mass of a hydrogen atom. The separation of the atoms in a nitrogen atom is 0.11 nm. Accordingly, the moment of inertia of a nitrogen molecule is thirty one times that of a hydrogen molecule, so that down to very low temperatures the value of kT is considerably higher than W_m and there is practically no 'freezing out' of rotational degrees of freedom. At the same time, for monatomic gases, whose moment of inertia is several orders of magnitude lower than that of hydrogen, the minimal energy of rotational motion is so high that even at very high temperatures only the translational degrees of freedom manifest themselves and the heat capacity follows the predictions of classical theory quite accurately."

    "Questions": "When diatomic gases are heated, their heat capacity exhibits a peak in the high-temperature region. Similar behavior is observed in multiatomic gases. What is the explanation for this?",
    "Answers": "According to classical theory of heat capacity of ideal gases, the value of heat capacity for each given process (say, an isochoric process) must not depend on the temperature of the gas. This theory does not allow for the quantum nature of periodic processes, namely, rotational and vibrational motion. In classical theory, the probability of rotational motion of diatomic and multiatomic molecules is assumed to be independent of the temperature of the gas and the same (per each degree of freedom) as that of translational motion. Quantum theory requires allowing for the different probabilities of periodic processes, with the probability growing with temperature. Calculations have shown that for many diatomic gases at low temperatures the vibrational degrees of freedom can be ignored, but the role of these degrees of freedom grows with temperature. For sufficiently high temperature the bonds between the atoms may break and dissociation occurs. This requires large energy expenditure. In some respects this process resembles phase transitions (melting and boiling, for instance), when supplying heat does not lead to a rise in temperature."

Out of curves 0-2 and 0-3 the former corresponds to a higher entropy increment.

This result can be obtained without carrying out calculations, solely on dimensional grounds. Entropy (irrespective of whether we are speaking of the entropy of the system or the molar entropy or the specific entropy) has the same dimensionality as heat capacity (irrespective of whether we are speaking of the heat capacity of the system or the molar heat capacity or the specific heat capacity).

    "Answers": "The van der Waals equation presupposes complete homogeneity of the substance (vapor or liquid), that is, the same density in all (however small) volumes. In real media, however, there are fluctuations. Suppose we are considering state 2 on the curve (see the figure accompanying the problem). The parameters of this state (or point) determine the average values of the concentration and energy of the molecules. In small volumes the values of the concentration are somewhat larger or smaller than the average value because of the randomness of molecular motion. The same is true of the energy of molecules in small volumes. In accordance with the isotherm, in volumes of higher density the pressure is somewhat lower than the average, while in volumes of lower density the pressure is somewhat higher. Therefore, in the former the density continues to rise and in the latter, to drop. As a result the entire substance separates into two phases with a higher and a lower density, and the pressure in both is the same.

This isotherm differs from the theoretical van der Waals isotherm (1-2-3-4-5-6-7), which corresponds to a one-phase transition of the entire mass of vapor into liquid. On the van der Waals isotherm there are sections corresponding to metastable states (2-3 and 5-6), which can be realized in certain conditions. What are these states and what are the conditions for their realization?",
    "Answers": "Section 2-3 corresponds to supersaturated vapor. For this state to realize itself, there must be no dust, ions, or aerosols in the space where this state occurs for the vapor to condense on and form drops of liquid. Section 6-5 corresponds to the so-called superheated liquid. This state can be arrived at if we boil and degasify the liquid prior to heating it, then heat it in such a way so that it fills the entire volume of the vessel, and finally cool it again. The liquid will find itself under a pressure that is lower than that of the saturated vapor. Especially interesting is the state of a liquid corresponding to the section of the isotherm lying below the horizontal axis (see the figure accompanying Problem 2.40). This state corresponds to uniform stretching of the liquid. The state can be achieved by repeating, say, Torricelli's experiment in modern vacuum conditions. Before filling the tube with mercury, all gases must be evacuated from the tube via prolonged heating and the mercury must be pumped into the tube under a vacuum. In this case there is no Torricellian vacuum above the mercury when we turn the tube over, the mercury sticks to the inner surface of the tube thanks to molecular adhesion, and the part of it lying above the level corresponding to atmospheric pressure will be under negative pressure (see the figure accompanying the answer). Thus, it is possible to obtain negative pressure (uniform stretching) of the order of three atmospheres."

If we assume that the hatched areas in the figure accompanying the problem are the same, the works done along the paths 2-4-6 and 2-3-4-5-6 are equal.

It is found that in the process of heating the boundary between the liquid and the vapor above the liquid rises and the meniscus becomes flatter (Figure (b)). It is extremely difficult to observe the transition through the critical temperature because of intense convective fluxes, but the result is seen because at this temperature the meniscus disappears completely (Figure (c)). Upon slowly cooling the tube it is found that at the same temperature the entire volume becomes cloudy, so that light cannot pass through the tube (Figure (d)). If the temperature is lowered still further, the volume becomes transparent and there appears a meniscus, which separates the two phases. Explain the reasons for the observed phenomena.",
    "Answers": "When a liquid is heated, its density drops, so that the volume it occupies may increase notwithstanding evaporation. The decrease in the density of the liquid and the simultaneous increase in the density of the vapor lead to a drop in surface tension. As a result the meniscus becomes flatter and at the critical point disappears completely. Of special interest is the phenomenon of critical opalescence, discovered by T. Andrews in 1869, which consists in the medium becoming suddenly 'cloudy' at the critical state. This phenomenon serves as a vivid illustration of fluctuation effects. Extremely small fluctuations in the density of the medium, fluctuations that are due to the random movements of molecules, lead to a situation in which the density in some microscopic volumes becomes, at certain moments, somewhat higher than the one corresponding to the critical point, and these volumes transform into the liquid, while the neighboring volumes remain being a gas (the ones with the lower density).

    "Questions": "Two drops are placed between two parallel glass plates, a drop of water (Figure (a)) and a drop of mercury (Figure (b)). What forces act on the plates in each case?",
    "Answers": "The curvature of the surface of a liquid creates an excess pressure (known as Laplace pressure) directed toward the center of curvature. This pressure is the higher the smaller the radius of curvature of the surface. In the case of water, the excess pressure (negative) tends to stretch the drop, while in the case of mercury it tends to compress the drop. For this reason, the plates with the drop of water between them are under forces that bring them together ('attractive forces'), while the plates with mercury between them tend to move apart ('repulsive forces')."

    "Questions": "Inside two conical pipes there is a drop of water (Figure (a)) and a drop of mercury (Figure (b)). Where does each drop tend to move?",
    "Answers": "The excess Laplace pressure, caused by the curvature of the liquid surface, is directed toward the center of curvature of the surface and is inversely proportional to the radius of curvature. For this reason, the drop of water is under a negative pressure (that in absolute value is greater than the pressure acting on the mercury drop) in the narrow part of the pipe and this pressure is directed toward the tapered end, with the result that the drop tends to move toward the tapered end. In the case of mercury, the pressure is directed in opposition, that is, toward the wide end of the pipe, and it is in this direction that the drop tends to move."

    "Questions": "Which of the curves shown in the figure depicts correctly the temperature dependence of surface tension? Curve 1 falls off to zero at the boiling point of the liquid, curve 2 falls off to zero at the critical temperature, curve 3 tends to zero asymptotically, and curve 4 shows that surface tension is temperature independent.",
    "Answers": "Surface tension (the surface tension coefficient) is defined as the ratio of the free energy of the surface layer of the liquid to the area of this surface. The free energy here is understood to be the energy that can be converted into work. This energy is determined by the interaction of the molecules of the surface layer with the other molecules, where the interaction with the molecules of the vapor above the surface is usually ignored. As the temperature is increased, the interaction of the molecules of the surface layer with the molecules in the bulk of the liquid weakens and that of the surface layer molecules with the vapor molecules grows. At the critical temperature both interactions become equal, the interface between liquid and vapor disappears, and so does surface tension. Thus, it is curve 2 that reflects the correct temperature dependence of the surface tension coefficient."

    "Answers": "If we assume that the water wets the wall of the tube in an ideal manner, then, if the tube is sufficiently high (h > h₀), and the diameter of the tube is small, the radius of the meniscus is equal to that of the tube. If h < h₀, the water will rise in the tube and reach the upper end. After this the curvature of the meniscus will decrease until it reaches a value that satisfies the equation\nh = 2σ/(ρgR),\nwhere R is now not the radius of the tube but the radius of curvature of the meniscus, r < R."

    "Answers": "Although the cross-sectional area of all four pipes of diameter D/2 each is equal to that of one pipe of radius D, the volume flow through these pipes is lower. This follows from Poiseuille's law\nQ = πΔpD⁴/(128ηl).\nThus, the volume flow through each of the four pipes of D/2 diameter is lower than that through the big pipe not by a factor of four but by a factor of 16 (at the same pressure head), with the result that the total volume flow through the four pipes will be one-fourth of the flow through the big pipe."

The maximal velocity of the liquid (along the pipe's axis) is v_xm.",

The time it takes the particle to fall from the wall to a point whose ordinate is y is\nt = (R - y)/v_y.\nIn the course of this fall the particle will be shifted in the horizontal direction over a distance\nx = ∫(from R to y) v_x dt = -(v_xm/v_y) ∫(from R to y) [1-(y/R)²]dy = (v_xm/v_y)[(2/3)R - y + (1/3)(y³/R²)].\nAt the lowest possible point (y = -R) we have\nx = (4/3)(v_xm/v_y)R = (2/3)(v_xm/v_y)D."

    "Questions": "When ice with a temperature below 0 °C is mixed with water with a temperature above 0 °C, there are four possibilities: the ice melts and the final temperature is above 0 °C, the water freezes and the final temperature is below 0 °C, part of the ice melts and the temperature of the mixture becomes 0 °C, and part of the water freezes and the temperature of the mixture becomes 0 °C. On the horizontal axis we lay off the amount of heat that the water gives off in cooling and freezing (the upper straight lines) and the amount of heat that the ice absorbs in heating and melting (the lower straight lines). The scale along the horizontal axis is arbitrary, that is, the scale value is not specified. The temperature (in degrees Celsius) is laid off on the vertical axis. Find the final result of mixing whose beginning is shown in each figure. When either all the water freezes or all the ice melts, determine the final temperature.",
    "Answers": "Each figure accompanying the problem contains the initial segments of the graphs representing the cooling of water or the heating of ice. Continuing these graphs, we arrive at the intersection point in each figure. If the point of intersection lies above the horizontal line corresponding to a temperature of 0 °C, the final temperature is positive, when the point lies below this line, the final temperature is negative. If the graphs meet on the line t = 0 °C, the final temperature is 0 °C and the amount of the phase that has a horizontal section on the graph prior to intersection will decrease. The ratio of the length of this section to the total length of the horizontal section corresponding to this phase determines the fraction of the initial mass of this phase that has transformed into the other phase. When analyzing the graphs, we must bear in mind that the slopes of the straight lines are determined by the mass of water or ice and their specific heat capacity by the formula\nΔt/ΔQ = 1/(cm).\nHere one must bear in mind that the specific heat capacity of water is twice as high as that of ice. The length of the horizontal sections corresponding to the water freezing or the ice melting is determined by the fact that the amount of heat required for melting a certain amount of ice is equal to the amount of heat required for heating the same mass of water to 80°C. For the sake of illustration, Figure (a) accompanying the answer shows the diagram for the cooling off of a mass of water from 80 to 0 °C, then the freezing of this water, and finally the cooling off of the ice down to t = -40°C. Figure (b) accompanying the answer shows the reverse process in which the same amount of ice is heated from -80 to 0 °C, then melted, and finally heated in the form of water to 60°C. The scales along the horizontal axes are arbitrary but equal, with the amount of heat expressed in arbitrary units. (It is easy to see that all this has no effect on the answer.) The two diagrams are combined in Figure (c) accompanying the answer. In the present case we see that the final temperature is 0 °C and half of the ice has melted. Applying this procedure to the case illustrated by Figure (a) accompanying the problem, we see that the ice has completely melted and the final temperature is 10°C; for Figure (b) accompanying the problem, half of the ice has melted and the final temperature is 0 °C; for Figure (c) accompanying the problem, the case is similar to (b) but half of the water has frozen; finally, for Figure (d), all the water has frozen and the final temperature is -20°C."

    "Questions": "A phase diagram represents the relationship between the temperature and pressure at the boundary that separates two phases. To which phases do the regions 1, 2, and 3 correspond?",
    "Answers": "At the lowest possible pressures and the highest possible temperatures a substance may exist only in the vapor state (region 1). Compressing the vapor at relatively high temperatures, we can transform it into the liquid state provided that the temperature is below the critical. The curve separating region 1 from region 2 corresponds to pressures and temperatures at which the liquid is in equilibrium with the saturated vapor of this liquid, with the region 2 corresponding to the liquid. T_cr on the temperature axis stands for the critical temperature. By cooling the liquid, we arrive at temperatures at which there is equilibrium between the liquid and the solid phase—this corresponds to region 3. At low pressures there can be equilibrium between the vapor and the solid, but there is only one value of temperature and pressure at which equilibrium can exist between all three phases. This is the so-called triple point, and it is at this point that all three curves meet."

    "Questions": "The phase diagram of water is shown schematically in the figure. Using this diagram, explain this particular dependence of the melting point of ice on the external pressure.",
    "Answers": "As distinct from the majority of substances, the ice-water system has an equilibrium curve with a negative slope. In view of this, higher pressures correspond to a lower temperature at which ice and water are in equilibrium. If ice was under an external pressure p₁ at a certain temperature and then this pressure was increased to p₃, then at a certain pressure p₂, whose value lies on the phase equilibrium curve, the ice will melt. The anomalous dependence of the melting point of ice on pressure is linked with the anomalous relation between the densities of water and ice. As a rule, the density of the solid phase is higher than that of the liquid, but for water the situation is the opposite: the density of ice is lower than that of water. This property is extremely important for the preservation of life in ponds, lakes, and rivers. If the density of water were lower than that of ice, all ponds, lakes and rivers would freeze solid."

    "Answers": "Compressibility is defined thus:\nβ = -(1/V)(dV/dp),\nwhence dV/V = -βdp. Hence,\n∫(from V₁ to V₂) dV/V = -∫(from p₁ to p₂) βdp.\nIntegration yields\nln(V₁/V₂) = ∫(from p₁ to p₂) βdp.\nThe integral on the right-hand side gives the area bounded by the curve, the horizontal axis, and the vertical straight lines at p₁ and p₂. After evaluating this integral, we turn to the volume ratio. If the compressibility were pressure independent, the volume ratio would be\nV₁/V₂ = exp[β(p₂ - p₁)]."

    "Answers": "At a maximum point the derivative dρ/dt is zero. For this reason near a maximum the deviations in the density from the maximum value for small deviations in the precision with which the temperature is measured are at a minimum, with the result that in the neighborhood of the maximum the precision with which density is determined is the highest."

The sum of the two strains is zero:\nαΔT - σ/E = 0.\nHence, αE = σ/ΔT.
