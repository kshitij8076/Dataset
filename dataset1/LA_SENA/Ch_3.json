    "Answers": "The components of the electric field strength that are generated by the charges at the acute angles are equal and are directed toward the negative charge. If we denote the length of the hypotenuse by 2a, each of these components is Q/4πε₀a² and the sum is Q/2πε₀a². The component of the electric field strength generated by the charge +2Q is the same.

    "Answers": "Since in the case at hand all the electric field vectors lie on a single straight line, the vector sum may be replaced with the scalar sum. For unlike charges the direction of the resultant vector does not change while for like charges it does. In the case illustrated by Figure (a), the electric field strength is positive everywhere. Allowing for the signs specified in the problem, we conclude that the left charge is positive and the right charge is negative. Similarly, for the case illustrated by Figure (c), the left charge is negative and the right charge is positive. In Figures (b) and (d) the electric field strength changes its sign at the midpoint of the distance between the charges. Obviously, this can only occur if the charges are like.

    "Answers": "Since both electric field vectors lie on a single straight line, they can be added algebraically, just as we did in the previous problem. The electric field strength to the right of charge Q_b in the immediate vicinity of the charge is negative; hence, the charge is negative (the electric field vector is directed toward the charge). The electric field strength may be positive to the right of Q_b only if Q_a is positive and greater (in absolute value) than Q_b. The electric field strength is zero at point x₁ if\nQ_a/(l+x₁)² - Q_b/x₁² = 0,\nwhence\nQ_a/Q_b = ((l+x₁)/x₁)².\nAt all points that are to the right of Q_b the electric field strength is specified by the equation\nE_x = Q_a/(l+x)² - Q_b/x².\nTaking the derivative with respect to x and nullifying it, we find that the maximum is at the point\nx₂ = l/((Q_a/Q_b)¹/³ - 1)."

In which of the three regions (I, II, or III) are there points that (a) lie on the line passing through the point charge perpendicular to the conductor and (b) at which the field strength is zero?",
    "Answers": "No such point can exist in region II, since the electric field vectors of the two charges point in the same direction—from the linear charge to the point charge. In regions III and I the electric field vectors of these charges point in different directions. Let us examine each region separately. At a certain point to the right of the point charge, the electric field strength produced by this charge is\nE₁ = -Q/4πε₀x²,\nwhere x is the distance from the charge to the point. The linear charge produces the following field at the same point:\nE₂ = τ/(2πε₀(x+a)).\nThe sum of these fields is zero if\nQ/(2x²) = τ/(a+x),\nwhence\nx = Q/(4τ) ± √[Q²/(16τ²) + aQ/(2τ)].\nOnly the plus sign in front of the radical sign has any meaning, since the minus sign corresponds to a point to the left of the point charge, where the electric field strengths of both charges are added rather than subtracted from each other (the quantities are equal in absolute value). Now let us turn to region I, that is, to the left of the linear charge. To see whether there are points in this region where the electric field strength is zero, we determine the electric field strengths produced by the two charges in this region. For the sake of convenience we direct the x axis to the left and take point A on the linear conductor as the origin (see the figure accompanying the problem). Then the field produced by the point charge is\nE₁ = -Q/(4πε₀(a+x)²),\nwhile that produced by the linear charge is\nE₂ = τ/(2πε₀x).\nThe two vectors point in opposite directions, obviously. The condition that their sum is zero yields the following equation for x:\nx² + (2a - Q/2τ)x + a² = 0,\nwhence\nx = (1/2)(Q/2τ - 2a) ± √(1/4(Q/2τ - 2a)² - a²).\nThe net field strength in region I is zero if the radicand is positive, obviously, that is, if\nQ ≥ 8aτ.\nIf this condition is met, region I contains two points where the electric field is zero.

    "Questions": "Two mutually perpendicular infinitely long straight conductors carrying uniformly distributed charges of linear densities τ₁ and τ₂ are positioned at a distance a from each other. How does the interaction between the conductors depend on a?",
    "Answers": "Let us first solve this problem by dimensional considerations. Here are the quantities on which the interaction force between the conductors might depend: the charge densities, the distance between the conductors, and the 'absolute' permittivity\nε_a = ε₀ε,\nwhich obviously has the same dimensions as the permittivity of empty space ε₀, since the dielectric constant ε is dimensionless. The SI dimensions of these quantities are\n[F] = LMT⁻², [τ] = L⁻¹TI, [ε_a] = L⁻³M⁻¹T⁴I²,\n[a] = L.\nAssuming that these quantities enter the expression for force F with exponents p, q, and r, we can write\nF = Cτ¹^p τ₂^q ε_a^r a^s\n(C is a dimensionless constant), and the equation for the dimensions is\nLMT⁻² = [L⁻¹TI]^p × [L⁻¹TI]^q × [L⁻³M⁻¹T⁴I²]^r × L^s.\nThis yields the following equations for the exponents:\n1 = -p - q - 3r + s, 1 = -r, -2 = -2r, p + q = 2r.\nHence,\np = 1, q = 1, r = -1, s = 0,\nor\nF = C(τ₁τ₂)/(ε₀ε). (3.6.1)\nWe have found, therefore, that the interaction does not depend on the distance between the conductors.\nIt goes without saying that C cannot be determined by dimensional analysis alone. The same problem can be solved by direct integration via the Coulomb law. In the figure accompanying the answer, A stands for the point where the plane of the drawing 'cuts' the conductor with linear density τ₁. The electric field generated by this conductor at the point with the element dx of the second conductor distant r from the first is\nE = τ₁/(2πε₀εr).\nThe following force acts on element dx of the second conductor:\ndF = Eτ₂dx."

    "Answers": "The element of the disk bounded by radii ρ and ρ+dρ and angle dφ carries a charge (taking into account both sides of the disk) equal to 2σρdρdφ. At a distance z from this element and, hence, at a distance r from the disk's center (Figure (a)), the electric field generated by this charge is\nE = 2σρdρdφ/(4πε₀εz²).\nOnly the component of this field that points in the direction of r is of any interest to us since the perpendicular component is canceled out by an equal component (pointing in the opposite direction) from the symmetrically situated charge. For this reason, the charge on the disk limited by the radii ρ and ρ+dρ creates an electric field\ndE = (ρdρσ cos α)/z². (3.7.1)\nWe express all geometric quantities in terms of distance r and angle α:\nz = r/cos α, ρ = r tan α, dρ = r dα/cos²α.\nAfter substituting into (3.7.1) and canceling out like terms, we get\ndE = (σ sin α dα)/ε₀ε.\nIntegration from α = 0 to the value α_m corresponding to the edge of the disk yields\nE = (σ/ε₀ε)(1 - cos α_m) = (σ/ε₀ε)(1 - r/√(R²+r²)). (3.7.2)\nFor r ≪ R, angle α is close to 90°. In this case, E ≈ σ/ε₀ε, just as in the case with an infinitely large plate.\nLet us calculate E for r ≫ R. To this end we express cos α_m in terms of r and R:\ncos α_m = r/√(R²+r²).\nUsing the rules of approximate calculations, we arrive at\n1 - r/√(R²+r²) = 1 - 1/√(1+R²/r²) ≈ R²/2r².\nSubstituting this into (3.7.2), we get\nE = σR²/(2ε₀εr²).\nSince σ = Q/2πR², we have\nE = Q/(4πε₀εr²),\njust as for a point charge (see the problem).\nFigure (b) shows the variation of the electric field of the disk with distance (curve 1); for comparison, the straight line 3 corresponds to the field created by an infinitely large plate with a surface charge density equal to that of the disk, while curve 2 corresponds to the field of a point charge whose magnitude coincides with the charge of the disk. Dimensionless coordinates are employed in Figure (b): r/R along the horizontal axis and E/E₀ along the vertical axis (E₀ is the electric field strength generated by the infinitely large plate)."

In this way the force acting between the charged plates is measured, and this enables one to determine the magnitude of the potential difference between the plates. Is the equilibrium in the electrometer stable or unstable?\n* The figure does not show the protecting rings around plates 1 and 2 with the same potentials. These are used to ensure that the field is as uniform as possible.",
    "Answers": "If the field in the region between the plates can be assumed to be uniform, the plates of the parallel-plate capacitor interact with a force\nF = ε₀εE²S/2,\nwhere S is the area of the plates of the capacitor. Since E = U/l, with U the potential difference between the plates, we have\nF = ε₀εU²S/(2l²).\nThus, for a given potential difference between the plates, the attractive force is the greater the smaller the distance between the plates. If the upper plate is balanced by weights, a small decrease in the distance between the plates leads to an increase in the attractive force, while a small increase in the distance leads to a decrease in the force. In both cases the balance will be violated. This means that the plate equilibrium is unstable. There is a special set screw in the electrometer that does not allow the upper plate to move below the level at which the measurement is taken."

    "Questions": "A small thin metal strip lies on the lower plate of a parallel-plate capacitor positioned horizontally. The voltage across the capacitor plates is increased gradually to a value at which the electric force acting on the strip becomes greater than the strip's weight and makes the strip move toward the upper plate. Does the force acting on the strip remain constant during the lifting process?",
    "Answers": "The force acting on the strip when the strip lies on the lower plate is determined by the formula for the attractive force between the plates of a parallel-plate capacitor,\nF = ε₀εE²S/2 = QE/2,\nwhere S is the area of the strip, as if it was part of the lower plate of the capacitor. When this force becomes greater than the weight of the strip, the strip begins to move upward, but retains its charge Q = σS. When the distance between the strip and the lower plate becomes great, the strip will not only be attracted by the upper plate but will also be repulsed by the lower plate where the charge density will gradually become even. As a result, the force on the strip increases in magnitude. If we ignore the distortions introduced by the charge of the strip into the field (this can be done if the strip is small), we can assume that the strip is in a field of strength E and that the following force acts on it: F = QE. The charged strip induces a charge on the upper plate as it approaches the plate. This leads to a distortion in the field and a slight increase in F. Although in the above discussion we have considered a flat strip, the same line of reasoning is valid qualitatively for any small conductor lying, at the initial stage, on the lower plate of the capacitor."

The distance between the plates is d. Which of the two particles will travel a greater distance before hitting the positively charged plate if both fly into the capacitor at a point that is exactly in the middle of the distance between the plates?",
    "Answers": "Let us first solve this problem by dimensional analysis. The following quantities are present in the problem: the initial potential difference U that the electron or ion has to pass, the potential difference U₀ between the plates, the distance d between the plates, the sought distance l that the electron or ion has to travel before it hits the plate, the charge Q of the particle, and the particle's mass m. The equation for the dimensions can be written as follows:\n[l] = [d]ᵃ[U₀]ᵇ[U]ᶜ[Q]ˣ[m]ʸ,\nor\nL = Lᵃ[L²MT⁻³I⁻¹]ᵇ⁺ᶜ[IT]ˣMʸ.\nFor the exponents we have the following four equations:\na + 2b + 2c = 1, b + c + y = 0,\nx - 3b - 3c = 0, x - b - c = 0,\nwhence\na = 1, b = -c, x = 0, y = 0.\nWe see that the distance traveled by the particle (an electron or an ion) does not depend on the charge-to-mass ratio.\nWe arrive at the same result if we solve the equation of motion of the particle. Under the potential difference U₀, the particle acquires a velocity\nv = √(2QU₀/M),\nwith which it moves parallel to the plates, while the acceleration with which the particle moves transversely to the plates is\nw = QU/md.\nThe particle takes a time interval\nt = √(d/w) = d√(m/QU)\nto cover the distance\nl = vt = d√(2U₀/U)."

    "Answers": "Due to electrostatic induction, one side of the sphere becomes positively charged, while the other becomes negatively charged, and the sphere becomes a dipole. At first glance it might seem that since the dipole is oriented along the lines of force of the field and the field of the capacitor is uniform, no forces act on the sphere. But this is not so. The presence of the sphere will distort the field. The charge density, and hence the field strength, at the points of the plates that lie on the straight line that is perpendicular to the plates and passes through the center of the sphere will increase. The dipole will find itself in a nonuniform field and will be attracted to the plate that is closer to it. If the string enables the sphere to touch the plate, the sphere will lose its charge, which is opposite to the one on the plate. But the sphere will then acquire a charge that is of the same sign as that on the plate it has just touched. This leads to a repulsive force between sphere and plate, with the result that the sphere will move toward the other plate.

    "Answers": "If the distance between the spheres is not very large, the charges on the spheres are not evenly distributed over the surfaces. The effect of the spheres on each other results in that in the case of like charges the sections of the spheres that are farthest from each other will have an enhanced charge density, while in the case of unlike charges the sections of the spheres that are closest to each other will have an enhanced charge density.

The potential at every point in space is the algebraic sum of the potentials produced by all charges. To the right of Q₂ (except in the immediate vicinity of Q₂) the potential is positive.

    "Answers": "All the equipotential surfaces of the field between the sphere and the plate are convex downward (that is, toward the plate). Hence, on any straight line parallel to the plate, the points farther from the sphere have a potential lower than those closer to the sphere. Hence, the point charge is moved from a point with a lower potential to a point with a higher potential. This requires doing work against the forces of the electric field."

    "Questions": "Two parallel-plate capacitors with different distances between the plates are connected in parallel to a voltage source. A point positive charge is moved from a point 1 that is exactly in the middle between the plates of a capacitor C1 to a point 2 (or a capacitor C2) that lies at a distance from the negative plate of C2 equal to half the distance between the plates of C1. Is any work done in the process?",
    "Answers": "Point 1 has a positive potential with respect to the negatively charged plate of C1. This potential is half the difference in potential between the plates of C1 (and of C2). Since point 2 lies in capacitor C2 closer to the negatively charged plate, its potential is lower than that at point 1. When the point charge is moved from point 1 with a higher potential to point 2 with a lower potential, the electric field performs work equal to the product of the strength of the point charge by the potential difference between points 1 and 2:\nA = Q(φ₁ - φ₂) > 0."

    "Questions": "The space between the rectangular plates (with sides a and b) of a parallel-plate capacitor (the distance between the plates is l) is filled with a solid dielectric whose dielectric constant is ε. The capacitor is charged to a certain potential difference and disconnected from the voltage source. After that the dielectric is slowly moved out of the capacitor, which means that the section x not filled with the dielectric gradually increases in size. How will the potential difference between the plates and the surface charge densities on both parts of the capacitor (with and without the dielectric) change in the process?",
    "Answers": "Initially the capacitance of the capacitor (filled with the dielectric) is C = ε₀εab/l. After the dielectric is moved out of the capacitor by a distance x, the capacitance becomes\nC = ε₀a[x + ε(b-x)]/l.\nSince the total charge on the plates of the capacitor remains unchanged, the potential difference between the plates becomes\nU = Ql/(ε₀a[x+ε(b-x)]),\nwhere Q is the charge on the plates. Since initially the potential difference was U = Ql/ε₀εab, we have\nU/U₀ = εb/(x+ε(b-x)) = εb/(εb-(ε-1)x).\nThe field strength between the plates will increase by the same factor. The charge density in the part without the dielectric is\nσ₁ = ε₀E = ε₀Q/(a[εb-(ε-1)x]),\nwhile on the part with the dielectric it is\nσ₂ = ε₀εE = ε₀εQ/(a[εb-(ε-1)x]).\nInitially the charge density on each plate was σ₀ = Q/ab, or, respectively\nσ₁/σ₀ = b/(εb-(ε-1)x/b) and σ₂/σ₀ = ε/(εb-(ε-1)x/b).\nIn the part filled with the dielectric, the charge density gradually grows in the same proportion as the electric field strength and the potential difference between the plates, while the total charge of this part gradually decreases due to the increase in x. In the part not filled with the dielectric, the charge density first drops ε-fold (at x ≪ b) and then gradually grows, approaching the value it had when the dielectric filled the entire space between the plates."

    "Answers": "The charge of the solid sphere is\nQ = (4/3)πρR³,\nwhere ρ is the volume charge density. Outside the sphere, that is, for r > R, the electric field strength coincides with the electric field strength of the same charge Q concentrated, however, at the center of the sphere:\nE = Q/(4πε₀εr²) = ρR³/(3ε₀εr²). (3.28.1)\nOn the surface of the sphere,\nE_R = ρR/(3ε₀ε). (3.28.2)\nTo find the electric field inside the sphere, we isolate a sphere of radius r < R inside the sphere (Figure (a) accompanying the answer). The charge contained in this smaller sphere is 4πρr³/3. According to Gauss's theorem, the electric field at the boundary of the isolated sphere is\nE = (4πρr³)/(3×4πε₀εr²) = ρr/(3ε₀ε). (3.28.3)\nThus, the electric field along r behaves in two ways: inside the sphere it increases linearly with r according to (3.28.3) from zero to the value given by formula (3.28.2), while outside the sphere it decreases by a quadratic (hyperbolic) law, just as in the case of a point charge. The behavior of the potential inside and outside the sphere must also be considered separately. Inside the sphere,\n∫(from φ₀ to φ) dφ = -∫(from 0 to r) (ρ/3ε₀ε)r dr = -(ρ/6ε₀ε)r², φ = φ₀ - (ρ/6ε₀ε)r².\nAt the boundary of the sphere,\nφ_R = φ₀ - (ρR²)/(6ε₀ε).\nFinally, outside the sphere the potential is distributed thus:\n∫(from φ_R to φ) dφ = -∫(from R to r) (ρR³/3ε₀ε)dr/r² , φ - φ_R = (ρR³/3ε₀ε)(1/r - 1/R).\nPutting φ = 0 at r = ∞, we get\nφ_R = ρR²/(3ε₀ε). (3.28.4)\nIf this is taken into account, we can write for the potential outside the sphere the following formula:\nφ = ρR³/(3ε₀εr).\nFormula (3.28.4) can also be used to find the potential at the center of the sphere:\nφ₀ = (1/2)ρR²/(ε₀ε).\nFor the potential distribution inside the sphere we then get\nφ = (ρ/2ε₀ε)(R² - r²/3).\nFigure (b) accompanying the answer shows the behavior of the electric field and the potential inside and outside the sphere.

According to Gauss's theorem, the electric field generated by this layer is equal in absolute value (on each side of the layer) to\ndE* = ρdx/2ε₀.\nIf all the charges to the left of the isolated layer generate a field of strength E, the resultant electric field strength is E - dE* at the left boundary of the layer and E + dE* at the right. Thus, over a distance of dx the electric field strength increases by\ndE = 2dE* = ρ(dx/ε₀).\nIntegration yields\nE = ρx/ε₀ + E₀,\nwith E₀ the electric field at the left plate. According to the basic equation of electrostatics (the one that links the electric field strength with the potential),\n(ρx/ε₀) + E₀ = -dφ/dx.\nIntegration from 0 to x yields\nφ₁ - φ₂ = (ρx²/2ε₀) + E₀x, (3.29.1)\nwhere φ₁ is the potential of the left plate, which is zero by hypothesis.

Since the energy density is\nw = D²/2ε₀ε, (3.37.1)\nafter the dielectric is removed, the energy of the capacitor will increase ε-fold. Since the charge on the capacitor remains unchanged, the value of the electric displacement vector remains unchanged, too. If prior to removal of the dielectric the distance between the plates was l₁ and after removal it was changed and became equal to l₂, the fact that the energy remained unchanged in the process can be expressed as follows:\nD²Sl₁/ε₀ε₁ = D²Sl₂/ε₀ε₂.\nHence the distance between the plates must be decreased ε-fold. Formula (3.37.1) shows that after the dielectric is removed (but prior to changing the distance between the plates) the capacitor increases its energy.

    "Answers": "Since the capacitor voltage remains constant, the energy stored in the capacitor, W = U²C/2, decreases because when the dielectric is removed, the capacitance decreases ε-fold. If the entire system consisting of the DC source and the capacitor is considered, it can be seen that the charge flows from the capacitor to the source when the dielectric is being removed. A fraction of the energy stored in the capacitor is spent on heating the leads that connect the capacitor with the source of potential, while still another fraction goes into the source. Note that removing the dielectric from the capacitor requires performing mechanical work, which must be included in the general energy balance. It is expedient, for the sake of comparison, to consider the reverse process, the introduction of a dielectric into the capacitor. Since in this case the capacitance of the capacitor grows, the energy grows, too. This growth is provided by the energy stored in the source (a DC source), which supplies the capacitor with the necessary charge as the capacitance is increased."

When the capacitor is submerged into liquid dielectric, its capacitance increases, with the result that the energy stored by the capacitor decreases, since the charge on it remains unchanged. Thus, if the liquid dielectric is 'sucked' into the capacitor, the capacitor-dielectric system goes over to a state with a lower energy. This process continues until the decrease in energy is compensated for by the increase in the potential energy of the layer of dielectric between the plates in the gravitation field of the earth.

There we found that into the general energy balance one must include the energy flow through the current source, which uses a fraction of its energy to increase the energy stored in the capacitor when the capacitor is submerged into the dielectric. The liquid dielectric must be 'sucked' into the capacitor, just as in the previous problem. The effect of the capacitor's field on the dielectric can also be taken into account by considering the polarization of the dielectric. As a result of this process, each volume element of the dielectric becomes a dipole and is pulled into the field at the edge of the capacitor. The strength of this field is higher than that in the dielectric at a certain distance from the plates. After the capacitor is submerged into the dielectric, its capacitance will increase, while the potential difference between the plates will drop.
