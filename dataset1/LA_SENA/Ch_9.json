    "Questions": "A proton that has flown over a great distance hits a proton that is at rest. The impact parameter is zero, that is, the velocity of the incident proton is directed along the straight line connecting the centers of the protons. The mass of the proton is known, m, and the initial velocity of the incident proton is v₀. How close will the incidence proton get to the fixed proton? (See Fig. 9.1)",
    "Answers": "The protons move toward each other until their relative velocity becomes equal to zero. When the velocity is zero, the incident proton slows down and the immobile proton begins to accelerate, so that the distance between the two protons starts to increase. According to momentum conservation, when this happens, mv₀ becomes equal to 2mv, where v is the velocity of both protons at the moment when the distance between the protons is minimal. At this moment both the velocities and, hence, the kinetic energies of the two protons are the same. The difference between the initial kinetic energy of the incident proton and the total kinetic energies of the two protons is equal to the energy associated with the interaction between the protons:\nmv₀²/2 - 2 * m(v₀/2)²/2 = e²/(4πε₀r),\nwhence\nr = e² / (πε₀mv₀²)."

    "Questions": "Suppose that the energy required to ionize a hydrogen atom is Wᵢ. Must the electron, the hydrogen ion, and the helium ion have the same initial kinetic energies for the hydrogen atom to become ionized?",
    "Answers": "Assuming that ionization occurs as a result of a completely inelastic collision, we can write\nmv₀ = (m + m_H)u,\nwhere m is the mass of the incident particle, m_H the mass of a hydrogen atom, v₀ the initial velocity of the incident particle, and u the final common velocity of the particle after collision. Prior to collision, the kinetic energy of the incident particle was\nW₀ = mv₀²/2.\nThe total kinetic energy after collision is\nW = ((m+m_H)u²)/2 = (m²v₀²)/(2(m+m_H)).\nThe decrease in kinetic energy must be equal to the ionization energy:\nW₀ - W = Wᵢ = (m_H/(m+m_H))W₀.\nThe greater the mass of the incident particle, the smaller the fraction of the initial kinetic energy that can be used for ionization. When an electron is used as the ionization agent, the initial kinetic energy of the electron is almost completely used for ionization. When an accelerated ion of hydrogen is used for ionization, the initial kinetic energy must double that of the electron, and when ionization is initiated by a helium atom, the energy must be five times that of the electron. This estimate explains why in a gas-discharge plasma, ionization is initiated almost exclusively by electrons, while ionization by the proper ions plays practically no role."

    "Answers": "The kinetic energy of the electron in a hydrogen-like atom is\nW_kin = me⁴Z² / (8ε₀²n²h²),\nwhile the potential energy is\nW_pot = -me⁴Z² / (4ε₀²n²h²).\nAs n grows (i.e. as the electron moves to higher levels), W_kin decreases in inverse proportion to n², while W_pot grows, tending to the maximal value of W_pot = 0 as n → ∞. The total energy,\nW = -me⁴Z² / (8ε₀²n²h²),\nalso tends to zero as n → ∞. The minimal value of the total energy is\nW_min = -me⁴Z² / (8ε₀²h²).\nObviously, to detach the electron from the atom, the following work must be performed:\nA = W_max - W_min = 0 - (-me⁴Z² / (8ε₀²h²)) = me⁴Z² / (8ε₀²h²).\nThe ratio of this quantity to the elementary charge e is known as the ionization potential. This is the minimal potential difference that a particle of infinitely small mass and carrying the elementary charge (practically an electron) must pass for the given atom to become ionized."

    "Questions": "The quantum levels of atoms of hydrogen and deuterium are only approximately the same (the difference between the two systems of levels is exaggerated in the figure). Which system of levels belongs to which atom? What is the reason for this discrepancy? (See Fig. 9.4)",
    "Answers": "The wave number of the emission lines of a hydrogen-like atom (when an electron “travels” from one quantum level to another) is given by the formula\nν̃ = RZ²(1/k² - 1/n²),\nwhere R is the Rydberg constant. For a nucleus of infinite mass,\nR_∞ = me⁴ / (8ε₀²h²c).\nFor a nucleus that has a finite mass M we must substitute the reduced mass\nμ = m / (1 + m/M)\nfor the electron mass m. Assuming that the electron energy is zero at infinity, we arrive at the following formula for the energy level with the principal quantum number n:\nW_n = -R_∞ch / (n²(1+m/M)).\nThis formula shows that the greater the mass of the nucleus, the deeper are the levels of the nucleus and the greater the separation of the levels and the higher the frequency of the spectral line reflecting the transition between levels with the same initial quantum numbers and the same final quantum numbers. Of course, since m << M, the difference between the corresponding values is small, but for hydrogen and deuterium it is sufficiently high.

What is the meaning of the lines that lie in between the lines of the Balmer series? (See Fig. 9.5)",
    "Answers": "An ionized helium atom belongs to the class of atoms known as hydrogen-like, for which the following general series formula is valid:\nν̃ = R_M Z²(1/k² - 1/n²),\nwhere Z is the proton number. The Rydberg constant for an atom whose mass is M is\nR_M = R_∞ (1 / (1 + m/M)). (9.5.1)\nIf we ignore the difference between the Rydberg constants for hydrogen and a helium ion, then it can be assumed that the lines of the first coincide with those of the second.

What must the principal quantum number of the electron level in a doubly ionized lithium atom be for the lines emitted when electrons go over to this level to lie close to the lines of the Balmer series? What is the overall number of lines lying in this wavelength region?",
    "Answers": "For a doubly ionized lithium atom, Z = 3. For this reason the spectral lines of the lithium ion are described by the general series formula\nν̃ = 9R(1/k_Li² - 1/n_Li²).\nFor the Balmer series we have k_H = 2, whereby only the lines of lithium that obey the relationship 9/k_Li² = 1/4 can be found in the visible spectrum. Hence\nk_Li = 6.\nThe last line in the Balmer series corresponds to a value of the principal quantum number n_H being equal to 6. The corresponding line for lithium exists at 9/n_Li² = 1/6², that is, at\nn_Li = 18.\nThus, in the spectral region of the first four lines of the Balmer series the overall number of lines is 12 (n_Li = 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18). The lines with n_Li = 9, 12, 15, 18 lie close to the lines in the Balmer series with n_H = 3, 4, 5, 6. Since there is a small difference in the values of the Rydberg constant, these lines do not coincide exactly. The difference is somewhat greater than in the case of the Pickering series."

Can an external electric field be created that is capable of neutralizing the Coulomb force and ionizing, say, a hydrogen atom? Field strengths that can be created by modern devices are about 10⁷ to 10⁸ V/m.",
    "Answers": "The electric field in which the electron is moving is\nE = e / (4πε₀r²), (9.7.1)\nwhere r is the radius of the electron orbit according to the “classical” Bohr theory. In the ground state of the hydrogen atom, the radius of the orbit is r₁ = 5.29 × 10⁻¹¹ m. Formula (9.7.1) then yields the following value for the electric field strength:\nE = 5.15 × 10¹¹ V/m,\nwhich exceeds all practically attainable field strengths by several orders of magnitude. However, if an electron is moving along a circular orbit which corresponds to a value of the principal quantum number that differs from unity, the radius of such an orbit is\nr = r₁n²,\nand the electric field strength proves to be inversely proportional to n². If, say, n = 10, the electric field lies within the limits of practically attainable fields.

    "Questions": "In a He-Ne laser, the helium atoms are excited from the ground state to two sublevels, 2¹S and 2³S, interact with Ne atoms, and give off their energy to Ne atoms, with the result that the latter are transferred to the 3S and 2S levels. The Ne atoms in these states emit radiation and go over to the 2P level. In the figure, the 3S and 2S levels, each consisting of four sublevels, and the 2P level, which consists of ten sublevels, are depicted by broad black bands. In addition to the above-mentioned transitions, a transition from the 3S state to the 3P level is possible, but we do not show this transition in the figure. From the 2P state, Ne atoms go over to the 1S state, and then gradually return to their ground state. Why don't He atoms emit radiation during transitions from the 2¹S and 2³S states directly to the ground state? What must be the relationship between the lifetimes of He atoms in states 3S, 2S, and 2P for continuous generation of radiation to be possible? It has been established that of the two transitions, 3S → 2P and 2S → 2P, one is accompanied by radiation in the visible spectrum and the other, in the IR spectrum. Which transition corresponds to which spectrum? (See Fig. 9.8)",
    "Answers": "Optical transitions between the ground state of helium and the 2¹S and 2³S states are forbidden by selection rules. Although the selection rules that forbid such transitions are not absolute, they nevertheless permit defining the 2¹S and 2³S states as metastable with lifetimes of the order of 10⁻³ s, which is an extremely large time interval on the scale of atomic processes. Excitation to such levels is possible in a discharge almost exclusively due to electron impact. What is needed for continuous generation of radiation is inverted population of levels. This becomes possible if the lifetime on the higher level exceeds considerably the lifetime on the lower level, with the result that the lower level has time to “get rid” of the electrons before new electrons arrive. Indeed, the lifetime of the 2S and 3S atomic states is of the order of 10⁻⁶ s, while the lifetime of state 2P is of the order of 10⁻⁸ s. In the first of the two transitions 3S → 2P and 2S → 2P the energy changes by a larger amount; hence a quantum of a higher frequency corresponds to this transition, and this frequency lies in the visible spectrum (λ = 632.8 nm), while the second transition corresponds to a quantum with a lower frequency, λ = 1153 nm, which lies in the IR region."

    "Answers": "Since the length of all the vectors is the same, the absolute values of the angular momenta in all the states are the same, too. If the orbital quantum number is l, the magnetic quantum number m may assume 2l + 1 different values. The figure accompanying the problem shows five different states. Hence, l = 2.

Why does the experiment require a nonuniform field? (See Fig. 9.10 from questions PDF)",
    "Answers": "In a uniform magnetic field, a magnetic dipole, which is an object possessing a magnetic moment, experiences only a torque. For a force to act on a magnetic dipole, the field must be nonuniform. For an atomic magnetic moment this force is defined by the expression\nF = μ(dB/dz), (9.10.1)\nwhere μ is the magnetic moment of the atom. In formula (9.10.1) we assume that the vector of magnetic induction of the magnetic field generated by the atom is oriented along the lines of force of the external magnetic field and its direction coincides with that of the induction B of the external magnetic field or is opposite. In the first case the atom is pulled into the region where the field is stronger, while in the second case it is pushed out of that region. In the Stern-Gerlach experiment, the beam of silver atoms is sent through the (nonuniform) magnetic field and splits into two beams in accordance with two possible directions of the magnetic moment of a silver atom. If there was no spatial quantization, the silver atom would be oriented at random and the beam would spread in all directions. The silver atoms in the beam are in the ground state, whereby the difference in orientation is due to the different directions of the magnetic moment of outer electrons in silver atoms."

How will the distribution change if the voltage is decreased three-fold, that is, U₂ = (1/3) U₁? (See Fig. 9.11 from questions PDF)",
    "Answers": "The minimal wavelength in the X-ray spectrum is determined by the maximal energy which a bombarding electron may transfer to the anode. This energy is eU and, hence,\nλ_min = ch/eU.\nIf the voltage is decreased three-fold, the minimal wavelength increases three-fold, too. As the figure accompanying the problem shows, as a result of such an increase in the wavelength the short-wave peak, which is one of the characteristics of the material of the anode, disappears. Separate characteristic peaks may disappear even when the wavelength corresponding to these peaks is longer than λ_min if to excite the quantum level from which the transition that generates the radiation with the wavelength of a particular peak begins an energy higher than eU₀ is required."

The distance between the nodes of a standing wave function is equal to one-half of the de Broglie wavelength:\nλ/2 = h/2mv.\nThe maximal value of λ is a, which means that the electron velocity has a minimal value v = h/2ma, and hence the minimal value of the electron energy is W_min = h²/8ma².

(See Fig. 9.15 from questions PDF)",
    "Answers": "From the viewpoint of classical mechanics, for E < P this probability is zero in both cases, while for E > P it is equal to unity (“step” 1 in Figures (a) and (b) accompanying the answer). From the viewpoint of quantum mechanics, however, in the first case for E < P the probability is also zero, whereas for E > P the probability is lower than unity (curve 2 in Figure (a) accompanying the answer), since there is a nonzero probability of the electrons being reflected from the step, in other words, a fraction of the electrons moving from left to right begins to move in the opposite direction. Partial reflection takes place even when the potential energy to the left of x₀ is greater than the potential energy to the right of x₀ rather than lower. For the potential barrier depicted in Figure (b) accompanying the problem there is a nonzero probability of the electrons tunneling through the barrier even when E < P, but this probability does not become equal to unity even when E > P (curve 2 in Figure (b) accompanying the answer). The passage of electrons through the potential barrier when E < P under the conditions that the barrier has a finite width and that the potential energy to the right of the barrier is equal to or less than to the left of the barrier became known as the tunneling effect. This effect is encountered in many atomic and nuclear processes and in the field emission of electrons by metals and semiconductors.

The passage of the electron into region III, which is forbidden from the classical standpoint, can be observed in experiments if the width of region II is sufficiently small (of the order of the electron wavelength in region I) and if the difference between P and E is not too great (see Problem 9.15).

In relation to a solid body, this means that the thermal oscillatory motion of atoms or molecules forming the crystal lattice also ceases. Is the same conclusion valid from the standpoint of quantum mechanics?",
    "Answers": "The statement that the energy of the vibrational motion of atoms or molecules in a crystal lattice is nil at absolute zero contradicts one of the main principles of quantum mechanics, the uncertainty principle. If the kinetic energy is zero, so is the momentum. But if an atom or a molecule is at rest, its position is fixed. In other words, each coordinate and the projection of momentum on the respective coordinate axis are known with absolute accuracy. Meanwhile the wave properties of particles permit determining the collection of a coordinate and the respective projection of momentum within the intervals Δpₓ and Δx, where in accordance with the uncertainty principle\nΔpₓΔx ≥ h/2π.\nFor this reason the energy of the atoms or molecules of a crystal is not nil at absolute zero. The motion of these objects is vibrational (zero-point vibrations), and the energy associated with this motion is the zero-point energy\nE₀ = (1/2)hν = (h/4π)ω,\nwhere ω is the natural cyclic frequency of the vibration of a particle in the lattice.

In the experiment, the current of the scattered electrons was measured as a function of the applied potential difference used to accelerate the electrons. The results were plotted on a diagram, with the square root of the accelerating voltage laid off on the horizontal axis and the electron current, along the vertical axis. The curve consists of a number of alternating maxima and minima. As Figure (b) shows, the distance between the maxima at first is not the same, and the greater the voltage, the smaller the discrepancy. Explain the pattern of maxima and minima. (See Fig. 9.18)",
    "Answers": "The diffraction of electrons by a crystal obeys the same Bragg law as X-ray diffraction does:\n2dsinθ = kλ.\nIn this formula λ = h/mv is the de Broglie wavelength. Substituting the necessary constants (the electron mass and charge and the Planck constant) and transforming the units of measurement, we arrive at the following formula*:\nλ ≈ √(1.5/U) nm. (9.18.1)\nAccording to this formula, diffraction maxima are observed for the following wavelengths: λ₀(k=1), (1/2)λ₀(k=2), (1/3)λ₀(k=3), etc., with the voltages that determine the electron energy being U₀, U₀√2, U₀√3, etc. If on the horizontal axis we lay off the square roots of the values of the accelerating voltage, as is done in Figure (b) accompanying the problem, the current maxima must be spaced by equal distances. In experiments, however, this condition is not met exactly, and the smaller the voltage the greater the deviation from this pattern. The reason for this is that formula (9.18.1) contains the energy (in electron volts) of an electron inside the metal, and this quantity is the sum of the energy acquired by the electron in passing the potential difference and the difference in potential energies of the electron inside and outside the metal. Therefore, along the horizontal axis in Figure (b) accompanying the problem we must lay off √(U+Φ) rather than √U, where Φ is the internal potential in the metal. The quantity measured in experiments is, of course, U. Electron diffraction patterns obtained as a result of electron scattering on a metal lattice make it possible to obtain Φ.\n* Here U is the potential difference through which the electron travels and, hence, the electron energy expressed in electron volts."

    "Answers": "The stability of a nucleus is ensured by the fact that the Coulomb repulsive force experienced by each proton in the nucleus is equal to the force of nuclear attraction (the nuclear force). The Coulomb force falls off with distance relatively slowly (in inverse proportion to the square of the distance), while the nuclear force falls off very rapidly. For this reason the protons are held in the nucleus only by the closest neutrons, while experiencing the repulsive action of all the protons in the nucleus, even those farthest from a given proton.

The points at which these straight lines intersect the experimental straight line that represents the variation in the rate of counting determine the boundaries of the time interval in the course of which the counting rate decreases by a factor of 2.

    "Answers": "A shift to the right by one place in the Periodic Table occurs as a result of a beta decay act. The mass number does not change in this act while proton number increases by unity. Hence,\nn aᵐ → n+₁bᵐ + ₋₁β⁰, n+₁bᵐ → n+₂cᵐ + ₋₁β⁰.\nA shift to the left by two places occurs in alpha decay. The mass number decreases by four, while the proton number decreases by two:\nn+₂cᵐ → ₙaᵐ⁻⁴ + ₂He⁴.\nThe mass number of the resulting isotope of atom a differs from the initial number by four units.\nExamples of such radioactive transformations are the chains of transformations in the ²³⁸U and ²³²Th families:\n²³⁸U → ²³⁴Th → ²³⁴Ra → ²³⁴U → ²³⁰Th,\n²³²Th → ²²⁸Ra → ²²⁸Ac → ²²⁸Th → ²²⁴Ra."

    "Questions": "A number N₀ of atoms of a radioactive element are placed inside a closed volume. The radioactive decay constant for the nuclei of this element is λ₁. The daughter nuclei that form as a result of the decay process are assumed to be radioactive, too, with a radioactive decay constant λ₂. Determine the time variation of the number of such nuclei. Consider two limiting cases: λ₁ >> λ₂ and λ₁ << λ₂.",
    "Answers": "In the course of the time interval dt the number of nuclei of the new element (the “daughter” nuclei) changes thanks to the emergence of new nuclei as a result of the decay of initial (or “parent”) nuclei and the departure of new nuclei as a result of their decay:\ndN₂ = N₁λ₁dt - N₂λ₂dt.\nHere N₁ is the number of parent nuclei and N₂ is the number of the daughter nuclei at the given moment. According to the law of radioactive decay,\nN₁ = N₀e⁻λ₁t.\nThus,\ndN₂ = λ₁N₀e⁻λ₁t dt - λ₂N₂dt,\nor\ndN₂/dt + λ₂N₂ = λ₁N₀e⁻λ₁t. (9.23.1)\nWe start by considering the limiting cases.\n(1) λ₁ >> λ₂. If we rewrite (9.23.1) in the form\nd(N₂/N₀)/dt + λ₂(N₂/N₀) = λ₁e⁻λ₁t\nand assume that after a small time interval we can set e⁻λ₁t = 0, we obtain\nN₂/N₀ = (N₂₀/N₀)e⁻λ₂t.\nWith λ₁ >> λ₂ we can assume that N₂₀ = N₀, so that\nN₂ = N₀e⁻λ₂t.\nPhysically this means that parent nuclei practically instantly transform into daughter nuclei, which then decay according to the law of radioactive decay with a certain decay constant.\n(2) λ₁ << λ₂. In this case the number of parent nuclei can be assumed to remain constant over a sizable time interval and is equal to N₀. This transforms (9.23.1) into\ndN₂/dt = -(λ₂N₂ - λ₁N₀),\nwhich after integration yields\nN₂ = (λ₁/λ₂)N₀(1 - e⁻λ₂t).\nThe number of daughter nuclei tends to a constant (saturation) value (see Figure (a) accompanying the answer):\nN₂ ≈ (λ₁/λ₂)N₀. (9.23.2)\nOf course, over a long time interval this number will decrease in accord with the decrease of the number of parent nuclei, whereby a more exact form of (9.23.2) is\nN₂ = (λ₁/λ₂)N₀e⁻λ₁t.\nAn example of the case with λ₁ << λ₂ is the radioactive decay of radium ²²⁶Ra with a decay constant equal to 1.354 × 10⁻¹¹ s⁻¹ (a half-life of 1622 years). Its product is radon ²²²Rn with a decay constant equal to 2.097 × 10⁻⁶ s⁻¹ (a half-life of 3.825 days). If radium is placed inside a closed vessel, already after one month the amount of radon in the vessel will be only 0.4% less than the equilibrium amount, while the equilibrium amount, as shown by (9.23.2), constitutes only 6.46 parts to a million of the initial number of radium atoms.\nTo find the overall dependence of N₂ on t, we must integrate Eq. (9.23.1). The solution has the form*\nN₂ = (λ₁N₀/(λ₂-λ₁))(e⁻λ₁t - e⁻λ₂t).\nThis expression has a maximum at a value of t equal to t_m, which can be found if we nullify the derivative dN₂/dt:\nt_m = (lnλ₂ - lnλ₁)/(λ₂ - λ₁).\nThe N₂ vs. t curve is depicted in Figure (b) accompanying the answer.\n\n* To integrate Eq. (9.23.1), we introduce a new variable, z = N₂e^(λ₂t). This yields dz/dt = (dN₂/dt + λ₂N₂)e^(λ₂t), e^(-λ₂t)dz/dt = λ₁N₀e^(-λ₁t), dz = λ₁N₀e^((λ₂-λ₁)t)dt, z = (λ₁N₀/(λ₂-λ₁))(e^((λ₂-λ₁)t) - 1), N₂ = (λ₁N₀/(λ₂-λ₁))(e⁻λ₁t - e⁻λ₂t)."

    "Questions": "The track of a beta particle (an electron) in a Wilson chamber has the shape of a limacon (a spiral). Where does the track begin and where does it end? How is the magnetic field that forces the beta particle to move in this manner directed? (See Fig. 9.24)",
    "Answers": "As the electron moves in the Wilson chamber, it gradually loses its energy to ion formation, and it is on these ions that drops of mist form, which make visible the track of the electron. This loss of energy results in a loss of speed, which means that the radius of curvature of the electron trajectory in the external magnetic field becomes smaller, since\nR = mv/eB.\nThe wider part of the spiral corresponds to the beginning of the track, and the narrower part corresponds to the end of the track. If we take into account the negativity of the electron charge and the direction of its motion in the chamber, we can conclude that the magnetic field is directed toward the reader."

    "Answers": "According to Pauli's hypothesis, which was verified in experiments, simultaneously with the escape of an electron the nucleus emits a neutrino (more precisely, an antineutrino), which is the particle that carries off a fraction of the energy released in beta decay and which has a momentum whose vector sum with the nucleus momentum and the electron momentum is zero:\n_zX^A → _(z+1)Y^A + ₋₁β⁰ + ν̃."

Momentum and energy conservation implies that the proton has collided with a neutron. Which of the two particles has a higher energy if the neutron is considered to be initially at rest and free? (See Fig. 9.26)",
    "Answers": "The proton and neutron masses can be considered practically equal. When the proton and the neutron collide, the scattering angle after collision will be 90°, whereby after collision the direction of the neutron velocity will also make an angle of 45° with the initial direction of the proton velocity. Thus, after collision the proton and neutron energies are practically the same."

    "Answers": "A change in the direction of motion (following a collision act) by an angle greater than 90° is possible if the mass of the incident particle is smaller than that of the particle that initially was at rest (in the laboratory system). The mass of the atom and molecule of hydrogen is smaller than the mass of an alpha particle, while the mass of helium is equal to the mass of an alpha particle.

The velocity of one electron coincides in direction with v while the velocity of the other electron is in opposition to v. With respect to the nuclei the electron velocities (their absolute values, that is) are the same, v. Find the electron velocities with respect to the (fixed) accelerator and the velocity of one electron with respect to the other. (See Fig. 9.28)",
    "Answers": "The relative velocity, according to the relativistic formula for velocity addition, is\nv_rel = (v₁ + v₂)/(1 + v₁v₂/c²).\nThe velocity of the electron flying away from the accelerator with respect to the accelerator is\nV_a = 2v / (1 + v²/c²),\nwhile the velocity of the electron flying toward the accelerator is\nV_b = 0.\nThe relative velocities of the electrons with respect to each other are:\nfor the electron moving away from the accelerator, and\nV_ab = 2v / (1 + v²/c²)\nfor the electron moving toward the accelerator, that is, they are equal in absolute value.\nFor the sake of an example we assume that v = 0.9c. In this case the velocity of the electron flying away from the accelerator and the relative velocities of the electrons are related through the following formula:\nV_a = V_ab = -V_ba = 1.8c / (1+0.81) = 0.9945c."

    "Questions": "Within the framework of the “classical” Bohr theory, an excited atom is an atom one electron of which moves along an orbit that is farther from the nucleus than in the ground state (Figure (a)). When the atom goes over to its ground state (Figure (b)), the atom emits a photon. In the literature, especially popular-science literature, the common way to describe this process is to say that mass has transformed into energy. Is this actually the case? (See Fig. 9.29)",
    "Answers": "The statement carries no physical meaning whatsoever. First, there is not a single physical quantity that can transform into another physical quantity (time cannot transform into area, field strength into length, and so on). Second, for processes in relation to which this statement is usually made, the common conservation laws, the energy conservation law and the mass conservation law, are valid, that is, if isolated systems are considered. In the case at hand, these balance equations are as follows:\nE* = E + hν\nfor energy (here E* is the energy of the excited atom, E is the energy of the atom in the ground state, and hν is the photon energy), and\nm* = m + μ₀\nfor mass (here m* is the mass of the excited atom, m is the mass of the atom in the ground state, and μ₀ = hν/c² is the photon “mass”).\nThe first balance equation expresses the law of energy conservation and the second, the law of mass conservation (for the same process)."

    "Answers": "The ratio of the mass of a moving particle to the rest mass of that particle is\nm/m₀ = 1 / √(1 - v²/c²).\nThe kinetic energy acquired by a particle in an accelerator is determined by the following difference:\nW_kin = mc² - m₀c² = m₀c²(1/√(1-v²/c²) - 1),\nwhence\nm/m₀ = W_kin/m₀c² + 1.\nFor a fixed value of W_kin, the ratio m/m₀ is the smaller the greater m₀ is and, hence, curve 2 corresponds to the particle with the greater rest mass."

    "Questions": "The principle of operation of a linear accelerator is illustrated in the figure accompanying the problem. A charged particle is emitted by a source and is accelerated by a potential difference U between source S and cylinder 1. During the time it takes the particle to fly through cylinder 1, the potential difference between 1 and the next cylinder, 2, changes its sign and, leaving cylinder 2, the particle again finds itself in an accelerating field with the same potential difference U. The length of cylinder 2 is selected such that when the particle leaves this cylinder, the field will again change sign, so that the particle is accelerated anew, and so on. If the particle has passed N gaps between the cylinders, the energy it acquires is W = eUN (it is assumed that the particle is singly charged). Since as the particle is accelerated the path it traverses in the course of a single change in polarity between the cylinders increases, each subsequent cylinder must be longer than the previous one. However, at a certain high energy the size of cylinders ceases to grow. What determines the maximal length of a cylinder if the frequency of variation of the voltage between the cylinders is ν? (See Fig. 9.31)",
    "Answers": "If the kinetic energy of the particle is W_kin, its velocity can be found from the equation\nW_kin = m₀c²(1/√(1-v²/c²) - 1),\nwith the result that\nv²/c² = 1 - (m₀c²/(W_kin + m₀c²))².\nIf W_kin << m₀c², we arrive at an expression for the velocity that is identical to the one following from classical mechanics and electrodynamics:\nv = √(2eU₀N/m₀).\nThe voltage across the cylinders changes its sign in the course of a half-period T/2 = 1/2ν, whereby the length of the cylinders must increase according to the law\nl_N = (1/2ν)√(2eU₀/m₀)N¹/².\nHowever, as W_kin grows, the velocity grows slower and slower. For instance, for v = 0.87c, v = 0.89c, and v = 0.90c we have, respectively, W_kin = m₀c², 2m₀c², and 3m₀c². For sufficiently high energies the velocity of the particle approaches that of light and the length of the cylinders does not change any more: l = c/ν."

    "Questions": "Why are cyclotrons not employed to accelerate electrons? What generated a need for building more complex accelerators such as the synchrocyclotron and the synchrophasotron?",
    "Answers": "The operation of a cyclotron is based on the fact that the time a charged particle takes to perform a full circle in a magnetic field does not depend on the particle's velocity. The time it takes the particle to complete one-half of a full circle, that is, the time in the course of which the electric field between the Dees reverses its direction, is πm₀/Be. As the particle is accelerated, its mass grows according to the formula\nm = m₀ / √(1-v²/c²).\nThe particle moving inside a Dee will gradually begin to get out of step with oscillatory electric field between the Dees.\nThe electron mass is doubled already at an energy equal to 0.51 MeV, whereby the discrepancy between the time it takes the electron to make a half-circle and the period of reversal of direction of the field between the Dees becomes noticeable already at accelerating voltages of the tens of kiloelectronvolts. This, naturally, limits the possibility of accelerating to high energies electrons in cyclotrons.\nFor ions, whose rest mass is greater than the electron rest mass by a factor of 10³, 10⁴ or even 10⁵, the effect of increase of mass with velocity manifests itself at much higher energies. But here, too, there is a limit of acceleration of such particles in a cyclotron. To overcome this difficulty, other types of accelerators have been designed, in which the frequency of the electric field or the magnetic field is varied in the proper manner (separately or together)."
