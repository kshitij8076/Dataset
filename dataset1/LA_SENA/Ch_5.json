    "Answers": "If we use the right-hand screw rule, we will find that both in region I and in region III the directions of the magnetic induction vectors coincide and the resultant induction may vanish only at infinity. The same rule shows that only in region II can the magnetic induction vectors point in opposite directions (i.e. the induction created by the two currents), with the resultant induction vanishing somewhere inside II. If a is the distance separating the conductors, then the distance x from a conductor carrying the current I₁ to the point where the induction is zero can be found from the equation\n(μ₀μI₁)/(2πx) - (μ₀μI₂)/(2π(a-x)) = 0.\nHence, x = I₁/(I₁ + I₂) * a."

    "Questions": "A current flows clockwise in a flat square loop. In the plane of the loop there lies an infinitely long straight conductor carrying a current whose direction is designated by the arrow in the figure. How will the loop move in the magnetic field created by the current flowing in the straight conductor and how will the shape of the loop change as a result of the action of this field? (See Fig. 5.9)",
    "Answers": "Employing the left-hand rule, we will find that the force acting on the side of the loop parallel to the conductor and closest to it is directed toward the conductor while the force acting on the opposite side of the loop parallel to the conductor and farthest from it is directed away from the conductor. Since the first force is greater in magnitude, the loop moves toward the conductor. Employing the same rule once more, we will see that the force acting on the upper side of the loop is directed upward while that acting on the lower side of the loop is directed downward. Thus, the forces tend to pull the loop apart, that is, to increase the area subtended by the loop.\nThis will actually happen if the material of the loop is elastic.\nThe answer to the question can be obtained from a more general reasoning. The work done in the process of displacing a loop carrying a current in a magnetic field is A = IΔΨ, where ΔΨ is the increment of the magnetic flux coupled with the loop. The loop tends to move or change its form in such a manner that the magnetic flux coupled with it acquires the greatest possible value. The flux is assumed to be positive if inside the loop it coincides in direction with the flux created by the current in the loop. In allowing for the various changes in the flux coupled with the loop one must take into account the changes that are due to the changes in the shape of the loop. In the case at hand the direction of the magnetic flux created by the current in the straight conductor and that of the magnetic flux created by the current in the loop coincide, and since the induction of the field created by the current in the straight conductor increases as we move closer to the conductor, this will lead to a certain displacement of the loop. The fact that the square loop transforms into a circle as the loop's area increases also leads to an increase in both the outer and inner magnetic fluxes."

    "Questions": "A conducting loop carrying a current is placed in a nonuniform magnetic field. How will it move as a result of the action of this field? (See Fig. 5.10)",
    "Answers": "Both a torque and a force act on the loop. The direction of the torque is determined by the fact that the positive normal to the plane of the loop must point in the direction of the induction of the external field. The right hand screw rule is used to determine the positive direction of this normal, which therefore coincides with the direction of the magnetic field of the loop proper. In accord with the direction of the current in the loop, the positive normal points upward. In the external field the loop turns counterclockwise, with the magnetic field generated by the current flowing in the loop coinciding in direction with the external magnetic field. The direction of the force acting on the loop is determined by the nature of the inhomogeneity of the external field. Since a loop carrying a current and placed in an external magnetic field moves in such a manner that the magnetic flux coupled with it attains the maximal possible value (in the algebraic sense), when the directions of the external and the intrinsic flux coincide, the motion occurs in the direction of the field with the higher induction, which in the case at hand means from left to right."

    "Answers": "A similar question has been considered in Problem 5.9. Although in this case no external magnetic flux is present, the contour may influence the magnitude of the flux coupled with it by changing its shape. Since the area and, hence, the flux through the contour are maximal when the contour is in the form of a circle, the magnetic forces acting on the contour tend to transform the contour in just this manner. We can arrive at the same conclusion by considering the interaction of two elements of the contour that are opposite to each other. The currents that flow in these elements tend to move the elements apart, since they flow in opposite directions. The collection of all such forces tends to stretch the contour."

The points are at the middle of the solenoid (point 1), at an end face (point 2), and outside the solenoid at a distance from an end face equal to one-half the length of the solenoid (point 3). The plane of the contour and the plane of the cross section of the solenoid are parallel. At which of these three points does the contour experience the greatest interaction with the solenoid and at which is the force minimal? Is the force attractive or repulsive at these points? The length of solenoid is considerably larger than the diameter. (See Fig. 5.12)",
    "Answers": "The following force acts on a contour carrying a current and placed in a nonuniform magnetic field with the directions of the lines of force of this field coinciding with those of the field generated by the current in the contour: F = pₘ dB/dr.\nIn the case at hand, the force is determined by the values of the derivative dB/dr at different points of the field of the solenoid. The induction of the field of a solenoid of a finite length is given by the formula* (see Figure (a) accompanying the answer)\nB = (μ₀IN₀/2) (sin α₁ - sin α₂). (5.12.1)\nAfter simple transformations, the derivative dB/dr can be written as\ndB/dr = (μ₀IN₀/2R){ 1/[1+((r+a)/R)²]^(3/2) - 1/[1+((r-a)/R)²]^(3/2) } (5.12.2)\nFormula (5.12.2) shows that dB/dr is nonpositive for r > 0. This means that the force acting on the contour is attractive (in Figure (a) this force points from right to left).\nAt r = 0 we have dB/dr = 0, with the result that at point 1 the force is zero. This also follows from the fact that point 1 in the middle of the solenoid is the equilibrium point of the contour positioned inside the solenoid. At point 2 (r = a),\ndB/dr = (μ₀IN₀/2r) [ 1/(1+4a²/R²)³/² - 1 ], (5.12.3)\nwhile at point 3 (r = 2a),\ndB/dr = (μ₀IN₀/2r) [ 1/(1+9a²/R²)³/² - 1/(1+a²/R²)³/² ]. (5.12.4)\nComparison of (5.12.3) and (5.12.4) shows that the numerical value of the derivative is greater at point 2 than at point 3. It can also be verified that at all points outside the solenoid the attractive force (if the direction of the current in the contour is opposite to that of the current in the solenoid, the force is repulsive) is smaller than at an end face of the solenoid, and decreases as the distance from the solenoid grows.\n*Formula (5.12.1) can be obtained in the following manner (see Figure (b) accompanying the answer). The element dx of the length of the solenoid contains N₀ dx turns (with N₀ the number of turns per unit length). The induction at point A generated by the current flowing in these turns is\ndB = (μ₀/4π) (IN₀ dx R dφ / z²),\nwhere R dφ is the element of length of the turn subtended by an angle dφ. The projection of dB on the solenoid axis is\ndB₁₁ = (μ₀IN₀ dx R dφ / z²) cos α. (5.12.5)\nThe perpendicular component of dB is compensated by the induction generated by the symmetric elements of the same turn. Expressing all quantities in terms of angle α and the solenoid radius R, we get\nz=R/cosα, r-x=R tanα, dx = R/cos²α dα.\nSubstituting all this into (5.12.5), we find that\ndB₁₁ = -(μ₀/4π) IN₀ dφ cos α dα,\nwhich yields formula (5.12.1) after we integrate from 0 to 2π with respect to φ and from α₁ to α₂ with respect to α."

In tending to increase this flux, the contour moves in such a manner that (a) the magnetic moment vector associated with the contour aligns with the induction vector of the external field and (b) contour moves into the region of higher induction after the alignment is completed.

Contour 2 is oriented in such a manner that the forces caused by the currents in contours 1 and 3 are opposite in direction, equal in magnitude, and lie along a single straight line; thus, contour 2 is in equilibrium. Is this state of equilibrium stable or unstable? Consider the case where the current in contour 2 has the same direction as the currents in 1 and 3 and the case where the directions are opposite. (See Fig. 5.14)",
    "Answers": "Contour 2 is in a nonuniform magnetic field. If the current in this contour flows in the same direction as the currents in contours 1 and 3, contour 2 is attracted to the other two contours. If it is deflected from the state of equilibrium in some direction, then from this direction there acts on it an attractive force that is greater than the other attractive force (since contour 2 is in a nonuniform magnetic field), and this means that it will move in that direction and will be drawn closer to the corresponding contour. If the current in contour 2 flows in the direction opposite to that of the currents in contours 1 and 3, then it might seem that contour 2 is in a state of stable equilibrium, since repulsive forces act from both directions. But there is another reason for instability. For an arbitrarily small rotation of contour 2 there appears a torque acting on this contour, and this torque tends to rotate the contour into such a position in which the direction of the current in contour 2 coincide with that of the currents in contours 1 and 3. When this process is completed, we again have to deal with the instability considered in the first case.\nAnalyzing the behavior of contour 2, we see that in both cases the instability manifests itself through a general rule, according to which a contour moves in an external field or changes its form in such a manner that the magnetic flux coupled with the contour acquires maximal value."

    "Answers": "The work performed in moving a contour carrying a current is equal to A = I(Ψ₂ - Ψ₁).

In what parameters does the motion of one particle differ from that of the other? Determine which of the parameters is greater for which particle. (See Fig. 5.16)",
    "Answers": "The velocity of each particle may be decomposed into two components, one pointing along the induction vector, and the other at right angles to the induction vector. The component directed along the field does not change since the Lorentz force affects only the component that is perpendicular to the field. If we denote this latter component by v⊥ the Lorentz force is\nF = ev⊥B.

In the course of the same time interval, T, the particle also moves along the field by a distance h = v₁₁T, where v₁₁ is the component of the velocity along the field. The result is the motion of the particle along a helical line with radius R and lead h.

By increasing the current flowing through the two solenoids connected in series we can direct the electrons into a Faraday cylinder F, with a galvanometer G registering the resulting current.

    "Answers": "Since removal of the iron core results in a decrease in the induction and the magnetic field flux in the solenoid, during removal there emerges a self-induction emf, which opposes the reduction in the flux and, hence, increases the current flowing in the solenoid (the direction of the external emf, which supplies DC power to the solenoid, and that of the self-induction emf are the same)."

    "Answers": "The self-induction emf defined by the formula εₛ.ᵢ = -L(dI/dt) is proportional to the derivative dI/dt (for equal inductances), which is the greater the steeper the straight line. Hence, the self-induction emf is higher for the inductance for which the time dependence of the current is depicted by straight line 1.

In Figure (a), key K is initially opened and the current flows through the induction coil L and resistor R connected in series. In Figure (b), key K is initially closed and the current branches off to R and L. In both circuits the resistance of the coil L is much lower than R. Can an induction emf be generated in either one of these circuits that is higher than the emf of the DC source? (See Fig. 5.25)",
    "Answers": "In Figure (a), after key K is closed, the current flowing through the circuit that consists of L and R connected in series is initially the same as the current that was flowing before K was closed. For this circuit we can write Kirchhoff's law in the form\n-L(dI/dt) = RI.\nSeparation of variables and subsequent integration yield\nI = I₀ exp(-Rt/L).\nThe current falls off according to an exponential law, with the self-induction emf being initially\nεₛ.ᵢ. = -L(dI/dt) = I₀R,\nwhich means that the self-induction emf is equal to the emf of the DC source.\nIn Figure (b), after key K is opened, the current initially is the same as the one that was flowing in the circuit before K was opened. In this case, however, the resistor R closes the circuit. Since prior to opening the key the current flowing in the resistor was much weaker than that flowing in the induction coil, the voltage across the resistor after K is opened may initially become considerably higher than that prior to opening the key, which is possible only if R is considerably higher than the resistance of the DC source. One must bear in mind also that after opening the key the current in the resistor will reverse its direction."

A second contour, 2, whose radius is much smaller than that of the first, is moving with a constant velocity v along the r axis in such a manner that the planes of the contours remain parallel to each other in the course of the motion. At what distance from contour 1 will the emf induced in contour 2 be maximal? (See Fig. 5.27)",
    "Answers": "The magnetic flux coupled with contour 2 is\nΨ = BS,\nwhere S is the area of the contour, and B is the magnetic induction at the point where the contour has been placed. Accordingly, the induction emf generated in the contour is\nε₁ = -S(dB/dt) = -S(dB/dr)(dr/dt) = -Sv(dB/dr).\nThe induction of the magnetic field generated by the current flowing in a circular contour and measured at a certain distance from the contour on the contour's axis is given by the formula\nB = μ₀pₘ / (2π(R²+r²)³/²),\nwhere pₘ is the magnetic moment of the contour. Therefore, the induction emf in contour 2 is\nε₁ = (3μ₀pₘSv r) / (2π(R²+r²)⁵/²) = C(r / (R²+r²)⁵/²),\nwith C = 3μ₀pₘSv/2π. The sign of r determines the sign of the induced emf; when contour 2 is moved closer to contour 1, r is negative and so is the induced emf, so that the direction of the current in contour 2 is opposite to that of the current in contour 1. When contour 2 passes through contour 1, the induced emf changes sign. The maximal value of this emf can be obtained by nullifying the derivative,\ndε₁/dt = C ( (R²+r²)⁵/² - (5/2)(R²+r²)³/² 2r² ) / ( (R²+r²)⁵ ) = 0.\nThus the emf is maximal at r = R/√2. An emf of equal magnitude but of opposite sign is generated at the same distance but on the other side when the contours are brought together."

How do the current in the primary circuit (the one containing ε), the induction emf in the secondary circuit (the one with L2 and R), and the current in the secondary circuit vary with time? (See Fig. 5.28)",
    "Answers": "When key K1 is closed, a closed circuit consisting of a DC source and the induction coil L1 is formed. Since there is no resistance in this circuit, the sum of the emf's is zero:\nε - L₁(dI₁/dt) = 0.\nThe fact that ε and L₁ are constant requires that dI₁/dt be constant, too. Thus, a current linearly increasing with time will flow in the circuit (the solid line in Figure (a) accompanying the answer). The magnetic flux generated by this current is coupled with both coils and also linearly increases with time:\nΨ = L₁I₁.\nIn the second coil there appears a constant emf (Figure (b) accompanying the answer) whose direction is opposite to that of the current in L1:\nε₂ = -dΨ/dt = -L₁(dI₁/dt) = -L₂(dI₁/dt).\nThe current in the first coil increases with a constant time-rate as long as K2 is open. When K2 is closed, a current flows in L2, with the magnetic field generated by this current opposing the field generated by the current in L1. The fact that the instantaneous value of the flux coupled with both coils must be preserved requires that there be a jump in the current in L1, after which the current will continue to grow according to the same linear law (the dashed broken line in Figure (a)).

It constitutes a flexible solenoid that can be transformed into a torus if the two ends are brought together (Figure (a)). The leads can be connected to an AC ammeter, a ballistic galvanometer*, or an oscillograph. By circling a conductor with a Rogowski loop one can measure an alternating current flowing constantly in the conductor or even isolated changes in the current, such as those that occur when the current is switched on or off or when pulses pass through the circuit. Suppose the Rogowski loop forms a toroid that encircles a conductor carrying a direct current I (Figure (b)). The parameters of the loop are as follows: the cross-sectional area is S, the number of turns is N, the resistance of the winding is R, and the radius of the toroid is r. It is assumed that the width d of the loop proper is very small compared to r. At a certain moment the current is switched off; the current becomes zero in a very short interval. The ballistic galvanometer in the circuit of the loop measures the quantity of electricity Q that has passed through the loop (and the galvanometer). How can one find the current I that was flowing in the conductor prior to switch-off knowing the values of the above-mentioned parameters? * A ballistic galvanometer has a large period of oscillations.

The inductances of the two solenoids can be considered the same and equal to L. Here are the ways in which the solenoids can be connected: (1) the solenoids are connected in series and are separated by a large distance; (2) the solenoids are connected in parallel and are separated by a large distance; (3) the solenoids are connected in series, one is fitted onto the other, and the senses of the turns coincide; (4) the solenoids are connected in parallel, one is fitted onto the other, and the senses of the turns coincide; (5) the solenoids are connected in series, one is fitted onto the other, and the senses of the turns are opposite; (6) the solenoids are connected in parallel, one is fitted onto the other, and the senses of the turns are opposite. Determine the total inductance for each of the above cases. (See Fig. 5.32)",
    "Answers": "(1) The system can be considered as being a new solenoid whose length is twice as large as that of one solenoid, with a density of turns the same as that in one solenoid and with the same cross-sectional area. Since the inductance of one solenoid is L = μ₀N₀²V, where N₀ is the number of turns per unit length, and V is the solenoid volume, which in this case is twice the volume of one solenoid, we have L₁ = 2L₀. The same result can be achieved by considering the self-induction emf that is generated in the two solenoids connected in series. The total emf is equal to the sum of the emf's generated in each solenoid; hence,\nε₁ = -2L₀(dI/dt),\nwhich yields L₁ = 2L₀.\n(2) When the solenoids are connected in parallel, the self-induction emf in each solenoid is\nε₁ = -L₀(d(I/2)/dt) = -(1/2)L₀(dI/dt).\nBecause the solenoids are connected in parallel, the total emf has the same value. Thus, with a current I in a circuit that is external with respect to the solenoid, the induced emf is one-half the value for the inductance L₀. Hence,\nL₂ = (1/4)L₀.\n(3) In this case, the number of turns per unit length is twice as large as that of one solenoid, and since the inductance is proportional to N₀², we have (provided that the current remains unchanged)\nL₃ = 4L₀.\n(4) If one solenoid is fitted onto the other and the senses of the turns coincide and the solenoids are connected in parallel, the current through each solenoid is I/2 if the current in the circuit is I, while the flux associated with current I/2 is Φ/2. The total flux is Φ and the flux coupled with each solenoid is Ψ = ΦN₀. In each solenoid there is generated a self-induction emf equal to the one induced in a separate solenoid when current I varies. Since the solenoids are connected in parallel, this emf is the common emf of both solenoids. Hence,\nL₄ = L₀.\n(5, 6) In both cases the induction flux in the solenoids is zero, so that L₅ = L₆ = 0."

We position the conductor carrying the current in such a manner that it follows the magnetic meridian at the point where the conductor is present. Just as in Oersted's experiment, a magnetic compass needle placed under the conductor will be deflected. If the needle is moved along the conductor with a speed equal to the directional velocity of the electrons in the conductor (i.e. of the order of several millimeters per second), the electron will be at rest in relation to the needle and, since the magnetic field in the system connected with the needle must be nil, the needle will not be deflected. More than that, if the needle is moved along the conductor with a speed greater than that of the electrons, the needle will be deflected in the opposite direction. Are these assertions correct?",
    "Answers": "The reasoning is all wrong. Even if the electrons in the conductors are at rest in relation to the needle, the positive ions that are moving in this case in the opposite direction create, obviously, a magnetic field equal to the one generated by the moving electrons when the needle was at rest.

In the emu system of units both vectors coincide in magnitude as well, while in the SI system they are related thus: H = B/μ₀. Since the lines of force of induction are continuous, inside a bar magnet they are directed from the south pole to the north pole and are continued outside the magnet by lines directed from the north pole to the south pole. To determine the direction of the magnetic field inside the magnet, one must bear in mind that the circulation integral of the magnetic field vector along a closed contour must be equal to the algebraic sum of the currents encompassed by the contour. Since in the case at hand there are no currents, the circulation integral along any contour lying inside the magnet must be zero. If the contour passes partially through the air surrounding the magnet and partially in the magnet, the circulation integral may be equal to zero only if inside the magnet the magnetic field vector is directed from the north pole to the south pole.

However, the situation with the circulation integrals of the magnetic induction along these contours is quite different.

Reasoning in the same manner, we conclude that the circulation integral along contour 3 is zero. But in evaluating the circulation integrals along contours 1 and 2 that include sections of a medium with a permeability greater than unity, the circulation elements in this medium are μ times greater than in the vacuum (if μ is greater than unity).
