At which moment in time numbered successively on the time axis will the acceleration of the particle be maximal? How should one use the graph to determine the average velocity of motion over the time interval from t₁ to t₂?",
    "Answers": "By definition, acceleration is the time derivative of velocity, w = dv/dt. For rectilinear motion the vector equation can be written in scalar form. The acceleration is the highest when the derivative is the greatest, that is, when the curvature of the curve is maximal. The curvature is determined by the slope of the tangent line to the particular point on the curve. This corresponds to moment 2 on the time axis. Note that for curvilinear motion the question contains an ambiguity, since to determine the acceleration we must know the radius of the trajectory at every moment in the course of the motion in addition to the magnitude of the velocity. To find the average velocity, we must know the distance traveled by the particle in the course of a definite time interval. In terms of the velocity vs. time graph, the distance traveled is the area of the figure bounded by the curve, the time axis, and the vertical straight lines passing through the initial and final moments of time on the time axis. Analytically the distance is calculated via the integral\ns = ∫(from t₁) to (t₂) v dt,\nwhence the average velocity is\nv = (∫(from t₁) to (t₂) v dt) / (t₂ - t₁)."

What will be the motion of the particle at this moment for different θ's: rectilinear or curvilinear, accelerated or uniform or decelerated?",
    "Answers": "The acceleration vector can be decomposed into two components, the tangential acceleration wₜ, which is directed along the same straight line as the velocity of the particle, and the normal acceleration wₙ, which is perpendicular to the velocity. For instance, for θ > 90° (see Figure (a) accompanying the problem) the tangential acceleration is directed opposite to the particle's velocity and the motion in this case is decelerated, w < 0. The presence of a nonzero normal acceleration suggests that the motion is curvilinear. The situation for the other cases is as follows: for θ < 90° (Figure (b)) the motion is curvilinear and accelerated, for θ = 90° (Figure (c)) the motion is curvilinear and uniform, and for θ = 180° (Figure (d)) the motion is rectilinear and decelerated, w < 0.

The object can freely move along the generatrix of the cone, but during the motion of the funnel the body is in a state of equilibrium. Is this equilibrium stable or unstable?",
    "Answers": "For the object to be in a state of equilibrium in relation to the wall of the funnel the resultant of the forces acting on the object must impart an acceleration to the object together with the funnel. These forces are the force of gravity and the reaction force exerted by the funnel. Since the force of gravity is constant in this problem and the resultant must be directed horizontally, the direction and magnitude of the reaction force are determined uniquely. But the latter has a different value at different distances from the funnel axis. At a constant angular velocity of the funnel, the greater the radius of rotation the greater the reaction force. For this reason (see the figure accompanying the answer), as the object moves farther from the funnel axis, the resultant of the force of gravity and the reaction force acquires a component directed upward, while as the object moves closer to the axis, the resultant acquires a component directed downward. In the first case the object tends to move away from the axis still further and rises, while in the second case it tends to move toward the axis and lowers.

In such a system, every mass element of water, say, an element whose volume is equal to the volume of the piece of cork, is in a state of equilibrium due to three forces: the force of pressure of the surrounding water, the force of gravity, and the force of inertia, which is equal to the product of the element's mass by the normal acceleration of that element taken with the minus sign (Figure (a)).

    "Answers": "When the object is immersed in the liquid, two forces act on it: the force of gravity and Archimedes' force. If V is the volume of the object, the resultant of these two forces is F = V(ρ_ob - ρ_liq)g.\nFor ρ_ob > ρ_liq, as the object is immersed in the liquid, its potential energy continues to fall below zero, but slower than it would in air. The rate of this decrease is the higher the greater the value of ρ_ob. Straight line 1 in the figure accompanying the problem corresponds to an object sinking in a liquid. When ρ_ob = ρ_liq, the potential energy remains constant (straight line 2 coinciding with the x axis). If ρ_ob < ρ_liq, the potential energy of the object begins to increase when the object sinks into the liquid (straight lines 3, 4, 5), and the rate of this increase is the higher the lower the value of ρ_ob. The potential energy, while growing, cannot exceed the initial potential energy of the object in air (the dashed horizontal line), and the object can attain this level only when the medium exerts no drag on it. If this is the case, the object will sink to a certain level in the liquid, stop, and then return to the surface with the same speed at the surface as it had when it entered the liquid. Once out of the liquid, the object will rise to the height determined by the initial potential energy. After this it drops back into the liquid, and so on. Of course, under real conditions the drag exerted by the medium will slow down the object, and the greater the viscosity of the liquid the faster this happens.\nIf the density of the material of the object is one-half the density of the liquid, ρ_ob = (1/2)ρ_liq, then F = V(-1/2)ρ_liq g.\nIn this case the difference between Archimedes' force and the force of gravity is equal (in absolute value) to the latter but is directed in opposition to the force of gravity. The slope of the straight line must be the same as that of the straight line that represents the variation of the potential energy of a falling object. Straight line 4 has such a slope."

    "Questions": "The dependence of the potential energy W of the interaction between two objects on the distance r separating them is shown in the figure. What will be the distances between the objects that correspond to equilibrium positions? At what distance will the equilibrium be stable? (Answer the same question for unstable equilibrium.) What segments of the curve correspond to a repulsive force and what segments, to an attractive force?",
    "Answers": "The formula that links the force acting on an object with the potential energy of the object,\nF_r = -dW/dr,\nshows that equilibrium, which occurs when the force is zero, sets in when dW/dr = 0. There are two such points on the curve, point 2 and point 4. Since when the object moves away from point 2 its potential energy increases while when it moves away from point 4 its potential energy decreases, at point 2 equilibrium is stable and at point 4 it is unstable. The fact that a system always tends to a state in which its potential energy is minimal implies that repulsive forces act on the 1-2 and 4-5 segments and an attractive force acts on the 4-2 segment."

Three cases are possible here, namely, (1) the bullet pierces the load and, retaining a fraction of its velocity, continues its flight, (2) the bullet gets stuck in the load, and (3) the bullet recoils from the load. In which of these three cases will the load be deflected by an angle α with the greatest magnitude and in which will it be deflected by an angle with the smallest magnitude?",
    "Answers": "Momentum conservation for the given problem can be written thus:\nm₁v₀ = m₁u₁ + m₂u₂. (1.31.1)\nwhere m₁ is the bullet's mass, m₂ the load's mass, v₀ the initial velocity of the bullet, u₁ the final velocity of the bullet, and u₂ the velocity acquired by the load as a result of the collision. From (1.31.1) it follows that\nu₂ = m₁(v₀ - u₁)/m₂. (1.31.2)\nIf the bullet flies through the load, after it has left the load it has a velocity that is surely greater than u₂. We write u₁ = u₂ + V. Substituting this expression into (1.31.1), we get\nu₂ = m₁(v₀ - V)/(m₁ + m₂). (1.31.3)\nIf the bullet gets stuck in the load, then u₁ = u₂ and, hence,\nu₂ = m₁v₀/(m₁ + m₂). (1.31.4)\nFinally, if the bullet recoils from the load, the velocity it acquires after collision, u₁, is negative and (1.31.2) can be written in the form\nu₂ = m₁(v₀ + |u₁|)/m₂. (1.31.5)\nA comparison of (1.31.3), (1.31.4), and (1.31.5) shows that the load acquires the highest velocity (and the greatest deflection, as a result) when the bullet recoils from it, while the lowest velocity is acquired when the bullet pierces the load."

    "Answers": "Let u₁ and u₂ be the final velocities of the impinging sphere and the one that was at rest prior to collision, respectively, and θ is the angle between u₁ and v₀. The equations that express the laws of conservation of energy and momentum (for each projection) have the following form:\nm₁v₀²/2 = m₁u₁²/2 + m₂u₂²/2, (1.33.1)\nm₁v₀ = m₁u₁ cos θ + m₂u₂ cos φ, (1.33.2)\nm₁u₁ sin θ + m₂u₂ sin φ = 0. (1.33.3)\nIf m₁, m₂, and v₀ are fixed, then u₁, u₂, θ, and φ are linked through three equations.

Plot the velocity vectors before and after collision in different coordinate systems: (1) in the laboratory system (in this system the velocities of the spheres are those specified above), (2) in the coordinate system connected with the center of mass of the two spheres, and (3) and (4) in the coordinate systems linked to each of the spheres.",
    "Answers": "We will consider each case in the order that it appears in the problem.\n(1) The directions of the velocities of the spheres in the laboratory system are shown in the figure accompanying the problem. If at the moment of collision we project the velocities of the spheres and the corresponding momenta on two axes one of which coincides with the direction of the initial velocity of sphere 1 and the other with that of the initial velocity of sphere 2, then in the first of these two directions the spheres exchange the respective projections of the velocities, just like in a head-on elastic collision. Sphere 1 stops in the process. Since in the collision the force acts along the straight line connecting the centers of the spheres, the initial velocity of sphere 2 is conserved, with the velocity of sphere 1, which is perpendicular to the initial velocity of sphere 2, added to it. As a result the velocity of sphere 2 becomes equal to the geometric sum of the initial velocities of both spheres, that is, v₀√2 (Figure (a)).\n(2) To determine the velocities of the spheres in the center-of-mass system, we decompose the velocity vector of each sphere into two perpendicular and equal components, v₁ₐ, v₁ᵦ and v₂ₐ, v₂ᵦ. The components v₁ₐ and v₂ₐ are equal in magnitude and point in the same direction. Obviously, the common center of mass moves in the same direction and with the same velocity, v_c, with respect to the laboratory system. Therefore, in the system linked with the center of mass there are only the velocities v₁ᵦ and v₂ᵦ. The velocities of the spheres after collision can be obtained if we subtract v_c from the velocities of the spheres in the laboratory system. The other velocities are shown in Figure (b).\n(3) In the system linked with sphere 1, the sphere, obviously, remains at rest during the entire collision process. The velocity of sphere 2 in this system can be obtained by subtracting geometrically the initial velocity of sphere 1 from the velocity of sphere 2 in the laboratory system. Since the velocity of sphere 1 after collision is equal, in the laboratory system, to zero and is also zero in the system linked with sphere 1, the velocity of sphere 2 in this system after collision is the same as in the laboratory system (Figure (c)).\n(4) In the system linked with sphere 2, the velocity of sphere 1 is obtained by subtracting geometrically the initial velocity of sphere 2 from the velocity of sphere 1.

Since there are no forces that act on the rod in the horizontal direction, the rod's center of mass moves downward (from C to B). As Figure (a) shows, the coordinates of the points lying above the center of mass by a distance a are determined by the equations\nx = -a cos α,  y = (R + a) sin α,\nwhile the coordinates of the points lying below the center of mass by a distance a are determined by the equations\nx = a cos α,  y = (R - a) sin α.\nThese equations imply that in the process of falling the rod (and that means all of its points except the center of mass) describes quarters of ellipses (Figure (b)) specified by the equations\nx²/a² + y²/(R+a)² = 1 (upper points),\nx²/a² + y²/(R-a)² = 1 (lower points).\nWhen the rod is falling, its motion can be considered as rotation about an instantaneous center, D.

The masses of the stations are the same. Will the energies and angular momenta of the stations coincide or will they be different?",
    "Answers": "Let us consider an extremely elongated orbit. In this case the distance between the foci differs little from the length of the major axis. Therefore, the force acting on a space station near the apogee can be assumed to be roughly the same for all extremely elongated orbits. Under this force the space stations move with the same accelerations w_e = v²/R, where R is the curvature radius of the trajectory, and v is the velocity at apogee. The smaller the radius of curvature, the smaller is the velocity of a space station, and the greater the elongation of the orbit, the smaller is the radius. Hence, the velocity and therefore the kinetic energy at apogee tend to zero and the space stations possess almost exclusively potential energy. Since the total energy of a space station remains constant in flight, at all other points on the orbit it is equal to the sum of the kinetic and potential energies. The potential energy of the interaction between the earth and the station (this energy is assumed to be zero at infinity) is\nW_pot = -GMm/a,\nwhere M is the mass of the earth, m the mass of the station, G the gravitational constant, and a the distance from the center of the earth to the station (this quantity is practically equal to the length of the major axis of the orbit). When circling the earth along a circular orbit whose radius R is approximately a/2, the station possesses potential energy\nW_pot = -2GMm/a.\nAs shown in the solution to Problem 1.49, the kinetic energy of the station in this case is\nW_kin = GMm/a,\nwhile the total energy is\nW = -GMm/a,\nwhich means that it is the same as for an elliptical orbit. It is convenient to determine the angular momentum of a station when the station passes through the apogee:\nL = mva.\nFor extremely elongated orbits, a is roughly the same for all orbits, but the greater the elongation of the orbit the smaller the velocity at apogee. Hence, the angular momentum at apogee is the smaller the greater the elongation of the orbit. But since the torque of the force of attraction to the earth is zero, the angular momentum must be the same at all points of the orbit. Hence, the energy of the station in a circular orbit and that of the station in an elliptical orbit coincide, while the angular momentum is the smaller the greater the elongation of the orbit."

If we consider the spacecraft to be a noninertial system, we can assume that on an object of mass m placed at the point farthest from the earth there acts a force of inertia\nF₁ = -mω²(R+D).\nAt the same time, there is the force of gravity acting on this object:\nF = G(Mm/(R+D)²).\nThe sum of these two forces plays the role of 'weight' for the object, or numerically the reaction of the support exerted on the object:\nF_w = mω²(R+D) - G(Mm/(R+D)²).\nBearing in mind that D ≪ R, we can replace (R+D)⁻² with (1-2D/R)/R². Thus\nF_w ≈ m[ω²R(1+D/R) - G(M/R²)(1-2D/R)],\nand if we allow for (1.51.1), we get\nF_w ≈ G(Mm/R²) - (3D/R).\nSince GMm/R² is equal, to a high accuracy, to the weight of the object on the surface of the earth, or mg, we get\nF_w = (3D/R)mg.\nThis expression gives the 'weight' of an object in the spacecraft at the point farthest from the earth. Assuming that D is 2.1 m and bearing in mind that R = 6300 km, we find that the 'weight' of an astronaut whose mass is 70 kg is 6.9 x 10⁻⁴ N at the point within the spacecraft farthest from the earth."

    "Questions": "A comet flies into the solar system from remote outer space. The trajectory of the comet is a branch of a hyperbola. Can the comet become a satellite of the sun S if the interaction of the comet with the planets of the solar system is ignored?",
    "Answers": "The potential energy of the comet (equal to zero at infinity) is -GMm/r, where m is the comet's mass, M the mass of the sun, and r the distance between the sun and the comet. As the comet approaches the sun, this energy decreases, which means that the kinetic energy increases, with\nmv²/2 - GMm/r\nremaining zero.* The angular momentum of the comet is also conserved, since the torque produced by central forces is always zero. If we take two points, one at the aphelion of the presumable closed trajectory and the other placed at the same distance from the sun on the second branch of the parabola, then the potential energies at these points must coincide (since the distances coincide), which means that the kinetic energies at these points coincide and so do the velocities. But, as follows from the figure accompanying the problem, the angular momentum at the aphelion must be higher than on the branches of the parabola, which is impossible. At the same time, at symmetrical points both the kinetic energies and the potential energies are the same, and the same is true of the angular momenta. The above reasoning is true for both closed orbits (ellipses and circles) and open orbits (parabolas and hyperbolas) of heavenly bodies moving in the field of a single attraction center. The fact that both the energy conservation law and the angular momentum conservation law must be satisfied makes it impossible for a central force to change the nature of a trajectory.\n* It is assumed that the initial kinetic energy of the comet in far-away regions of space is negligible."

    "Answers": "If D₀ is the diameter of the disk at rest, then in the system of coordinates with respect to which the disk is in motion the diameter in the direction of the velocity will be\nD = D₀√(1-v²/c²) = D₀√(1-β²).\nThe same is true of the ratio of the halves of the chord passing at an altitude y from the center:\nx = x₀√(1-β²).\nSince x₀² = R² - y², we have\nx² = (R² - y²)(1 - β)²,\nwhence\nx²/(R²(1-β²)) + y²/R² = 1.\nThe moving disk appears to be an ellipse with semi-axes R and R√(1-β²)."

    "Questions": "An isosceles right triangle is moving with respect to a system of coordinates with a velocity v directed along the hypotenuse. When viewed from this system, the triangle appears to be an equilateral triangle. Find the velocity with which the triangle is moving with respect to this system.",
    "Answers": "The velocity of the triangle is directed perpendicularly to the altitude, with the result that the length of the altitude is independent of the velocity. The hypotenuse is equal to twice the altitude (l₀ = 2h), while the length of a side of the equilateral triangle is l = 2h tan 30°. Thus, for the moving triangle we have l = l₀ and\n2(√3/3)h = 2h√(1-β²).\nHence β = 0.816."

    "Questions": "The various relationships that exist between time intervals, coordinates, and velocities in the special theory of relativity are conveniently illustrated via a system of coordinates in which on the axes we lay off either distance and time multiplied by the speed of light or time and distance divided by the speed of light. Curves that represent motion in such systems are known as world lines. Various world lines are shown in the figure in the x/c vs. t coordinates. What does each line represent? Is there a line that contradicts the main principles of relativity theory?",
    "Answers": "As Figure (a) accompanying this problem shows, the world line passing through the origin at an angle θ to the x/c axis represents the motion of an object moving away from the observer (placed at the origin) with a velocity v = c cot θ. The other figures correspond to the following cases: (b) an object moving toward the observer with a velocity v = c cot θ, (c) motion with the speed of light, and (d) an object is at rest at a certain distance from the origin. Case (e) contradicts the main principles of relativity theory since it represents the motion of an object with a speed greater than that of light."

    "Questions": "Three systems, A, B and C, are moving with respect to each other in such a manner that with respect to system B the velocities of A and C coincide in magnitude and are directed toward B (Figure (a)). When system A comes alongside system B (Figure (b)), the clocks in the two systems are synchronized. At this moment system A begins emitting signals directed at B and separated by equal time intervals T₀. This continues until A comes alongside C (Figure (c)), with N signals being set over the entire interval between the encounters. At this moment the clock in C is synchronized with the clock in A and system C starts to send signals directed at B that are separated by the same time intervals T₀. Find the difference in readings of the clock in B and C when these two systems come alongside (Figure (d)).",
    "Answers": "The time interval separating the signals received by B from A is\nT₁ = T₀√((1+β)/(1-β)).\nSince system C is moving toward A, its (relative) velocity is negative and, hence, the signals it sends are received by A separated by time intervals\nT₂ = T₀√((1-β)/(1+β)).\nSystem A will register N signals from B in the course of\nt₁ = NT₁ = NT₀√((1+β)/(1-β)),\nwhile the signals from C will be registered in the course of\nt₂ = NT₂ = NT₀√((1-β)/(1+β)).\nWhen system A meets system C, the clock in the first system will show\nt_B = t₁ + t₂ = NT₀(√((1+β)/(1-β)) + √((1-β)/(1+β))) = 2NT₀/√(1-β²).\nThe clock in C will show the time that is the sum of the time during which system A sends N signals prior to meeting C and the time during which system C sends N signals prior to meeting system B. Thus,\nt_c = 2NT₀.\nThe difference in the readings of the clocks will be\nΔt = t_B - t_c = 2(1/√(1-β²) - 1)NT₀.\nThe fractional variation in the duration of the signals is\nt_B/t_c = 1/√(1-β²).\nFor example, at β = 0.6 we have\nt_B/t_c = 1.25."
