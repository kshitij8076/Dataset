    "Answers": "The segment of the cross section of the loop of width dr and height h is penetrated by a magnetic flux whose instantaneous value is\ndΦ = Bh dr,\nwhere B = μ₀I/2πr. Whence\nΦ = (μ₀hI/2π) ∫[from R₁ to R₂] (dr/r) = (μ₀hI/2π) ln(R₂/R₁).\nThe flux coupled with the loop is\nΨ = (μ₀hIN/2π) ln(R₂/R₁).\nThe current in the conductor is I = I₀cos(ωt). The emf induced in the loop is\nεᵢ = -dΨ/dt = (μ₀hI₀Nω/2π) ln(R₂/R₁) sin(ωt).\nFinally, the effective value of this emf is\nεᵢ eff = (μ₀hNωI_eff/2π) ln(R₂/R₁)."

Construct a similar diagram for a circuit in which the current frequency is doubled and the emf amplitude is the same, and determine how the current will change as a result of this. (See Fig. 7.2)",
    "Answers": "The figure accompanying the problem shows that the capacitive reactance is four times the inductive reactance. If the frequency is doubled, the first quantity will decrease by a half and the second will double, which means they will become equal. As shown by the figure accompanying the answer, the ratio ε₀/I₀ will decrease, and since ε₀ must remain unchanged, the current grows. The same result can be obtained analytically. The amplitude of the current in the circuit is\nI₀ = ε₀ / √(R² + (1/Cω - Lω)²).\nPrior to the change in frequency, 1/Cω > Lω, and hence (1/Cω - Lω)² > 0.\nAfter the frequency is doubled, 1/Cω = Lω. Here I₀ = ε₀/R."

    "Answers": "The current in the circuit containing a resistance and an inductance connected in series is\nI = I₀sin(ωt + φ),\nwhere the amplitude value of the current is\nI₀ = ε₀/(Rcosφ - Lωsinφ), or I₀ = ε₀/√(R² + L²ω²),\nand the tangent of the phase of the current with respect to the voltage is\ntan φ = -Lω/R.\nFrom these expressions it follows that as the frequency grows the lag of the current phase in relation to the voltage phase increases, which results in a decrease in the current. The average power in the circuit is defined thus:\nP = (1/2)ε₀I₀cosφ.\nAs the frequency grows, the amplitude of the current decreases and so does the power factor, which is the cosine of the phase shift between voltage and current. The power will also decrease as a result."

How, knowing the maximal and minimal values of the power, to determine the numerical value of the phase shift between voltage and current? What is the period of variation of the power? (See Fig. 7.9)",
    "Answers": "If the voltage varies according to the law\nU = U₀sin(ωt)\nand there is a definite phase shift between voltage and current, so that\nI = I₀sin(ωt + φ)\n(where the phase difference φ may be either positive or negative), then the instantaneous value of the power is\nP = U₀I₀sin(ωt + φ)sin(ωt).\nIf we write\nsin(ωt + φ)sin(ωt) = sin²(ωt)cos(φ) + sin(ωt)cos(ωt)sin(φ)\n= (1/2)[(1-cos(2ωt))cos(φ) + sin(2ωt)sin(φ)],\nwe get\nP = (1/2)[cos(φ) - cos(2ωt + φ)]U₀I₀. (7.9.1)\nThe maximal value of the power is\nP_max = (1/2)U₀I₀(cos(φ) + 1),\nwhile the minimal value is\nP_min = (1/2)U₀I₀(cos(φ) - 1).\nWhence, the power factor is\ncos(φ) = (P_max + P_min)/(P_max - P_min)\n(bear in mind that P_min is negative).\nFormula (7.9.1) shows that the frequency of power variation is twice the frequency of the applied voltage. During one period of voltage variation the power passes twice through the maximum and the minimum.\nHere are some particular cases.\n(1) φ = 0. The load is a purely active resistance. In this case (Figure (a) accompanying the answer) P_min = 0 and P_max = U₀I₀.\n(2) φ = ±π/2. The circuit contains only a reactive element, that is, a capacitance or an inductance. Since in this case cos(φ) = 0, we have (see Figure (b) accompanying the answer)\nP_max = -P_min.\nThe work performed by the AC source over one period of variation of the power is zero. This means that during one half of the period the energy flows from the AC source to the reactive element in the form of the electrostatic energy of the capacitance or the magnetic energy of the inductance, while during the other half the energy is returned to the AC source."

    "Questions": "To demagnetize watches that have been accidentally magnetized, they are placed inside a solenoid connected to an AC source. The watches are then slowly removed from the solenoid. Explain why the watches become demagnetized as a result of such manipulations.",
    "Answers": "When a watch is inside the solenoid, the magnetic field generated by the solenoid forces the steel parts of the watch to change periodically their magnetization, following the hysteresis loop. When the watch is slowly removed from the solenoid, the magnetic field acting on the watch gradually decreases, and as the periods pass, the hysteresis loop shrinks. Each second 50 hysteresis loops are traversed, each being smaller than the previous one (the number “50” appears because the frequency of the AC source is usually 50 Hz). This process is roughly sketched in the figure. When the watch is completely removed from the magnetic field, it proves to be completely demagnetized."

    "Questions": "A full-wave rectifier (the circuit is shown in the figure) rectifies the current that flows continuously in one direction. Sketch the time dependence of the current, ignoring all losses, and, assuming that the load of the rectifier constitutes a resistance, calculate the average value of the current. If the rectifier is loaded to a primary winding of a transformer, is a constant emf generated in the secondary winding? (See Fig. 7.11)",
    "Answers": "At the moment when the “plus” of the voltage is at terminal a (see the figure accompanying the problem), the current passes through diode 2, resistor R, diode 3, and returns to the AC source through terminal b, which has the “minus” of the voltage at that moment. After the applied voltage changes sign, the current from terminal b passes through diode 4, resistor R, diode 1, and returns to the AC source via the negative terminal a. Thus, the current that passes through R consists of a series of alternating halves of sinusoids (Figure (a)). The average value of the current over one or any integral number of half-periods is\nI_av = (2I₀/Tω) ∫[from 0 to T/2] sin(ωt)dt = 4I₀/Tω = 2I₀/π ≈ 0.637I₀.\nIn carrying out this calculation in accordance with the conditions of the problem, it was assumed that the voltage drop across the diodes is negligible and that the rectification process does not alter the sinusoidal nature of the emf. As for the emf that is generated in the secondary winding of a transformer whose primary winding is the load resistance R, it must have two opposite symmetric sections, since each half-period of the pulsating current has an ascending section and a descending section. An idealized curve of the voltage in the secondary winding of a transformer is shown in Figure (b). Actually, the curve is much smoother because of the inductance of the transformer, which plays the role of a choke coil, the interturn capacitance, and other factors. The approximate shape of the voltage curve on the transient sections is depicted by a dashed curve."

    "Questions": "In the circuit shown in the Figure, a capacitor of capacitance C is connected in parallel with a resistor R. How will this influence the time dependence of the current? (See Fig. 7.12)",
    "Answers": "After the rectifier the current branches out (see the arrows in the figure accompanying the problem). A fraction of the current flows through resistor R and a fraction is used to charge the capacitor. If the internal resistance of the source (together with the diodes) is low, then the voltage across the capacitor is equal to the voltage at the “out” terminals. This occurs as long as the voltage is lower than the maximum of the pulsating voltage. After the voltage passes the maximum, it falls off and becomes lower than the voltage across the capacitor. Because of this the capacitor will begin to discharge through the resistor, with the voltage across the capacitor decaying according to the law\nU = U₀exp(-t/RC)\n(the discharge current is designated by arrows in the figure accompanying the answer). The greater the capacitance, the slower the decay, which continues until the voltage across the capacitor becomes equal to the growing voltage in the following half-wave. Then the capacitor is charged to the maximum of the voltage anew. The process continues in this manner. Thus, a capacitor in the circuit makes the “out” voltage smoother, and the higher the capacitance the stronger the effect. The curve representing the time variation of the current flowing through the resistor follows the voltage curve in parallel."

    "Questions": "Two semiconductor diodes in opposition to each other in series are connected to the primary winding of a transformer. Draw the oscillograms of the current in the primary winding and of the emf generated in the secondary winding. (See Fig. 7.13)",
    "Answers": "For both directions of the emf applied to the transformer, the current is limited by the diode introduced into the circuit in the blocking direction. This current is caused by the motion of the minority (intrinsic) charge carriers and reaches a plateau very rapidly as the voltage is increased. The diode introduced in the conducting direction does not limit the current. For this reason, the oscillogram of the current in the primary circuit has the form shown in Figure (a). Accordingly, the greater fraction of time in each half-period (in each direction) the emf induced in the secondary winding is zero. Only over small time intervals when the current passes through zero does an emf emerge, first in one direction and then in the other (Figure (b)). The oscillograms here are, of course, only rough sketches, since they do not take into account the inductances in the transformer circuits. Note that in modern semiconductor diodes the reverse current is negligible, with the result that the problem is of purely academic interest."

The amplitude of the emf applied to the primary winding exceeds considerably the voltage at which the diodes go into the saturation mode. Draw the oscillograms of the current in the primary winding and of the emf generated in the secondary winding. (See Fig. 7.14)",
    "Answers": "In some respects this problem resembles the previous one. Here, too, the current in the primary circuit is limited to the saturation current in one of the diodes, introduced into the circuit in the conducting direction rather than in the blocking. In contrast to Problem 7.13, the present one possesses a special feature that manifests itself in the initial section near the zero of the current in the circuit. While in a semiconductor diode the current increases with voltage almost linearly in the initial section, in a vacuum diode the voltage dependence of the current is described with sufficient accuracy by the three-halves power law I = KU³/². The constant K incorporates universal constants and the distance between the electrodes in the diode. Since the voltage varies with time according to the sinusoidal law, the current flowing through the diode on the initial section of the voltage increase must be written in the form\nI = KU₀³/² sin³/²(ωt)\n(the function f(α) = sin³/²(α) is depicted in Figure (a)). Allowing for this dependence, we obtain the oscillograms of current in the primary circuit (Figure (b)) and of the emf in the secondary circuit (Figure (c)). Just as in the previous problem, we have not allowed for the effects associated with the presence of inductances in the transformer circuits."
