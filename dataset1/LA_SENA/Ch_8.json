    "Questions": "Two biconvex lenses a and b with the same radii of curvature are manufactured from glass samples with different refractive indices. How should we employ the graphs that represent the dependence of the distance f₂ between a lens and the image of an object on the distance f₁ between the lens and the object in order to determine the ratio of the refractive indices?",
    "Answers": "The lens formula that allows for the parameters of the lens is\n1/f₁ + 1/f₂ = (n - 1)(1/R₂ - 1/R₁) = 1/F (8.2.1)\n(the sign of the radius of curvature is determined by the direction from the surface and to the center of curvature). The ratio of the principal focal lengths is\nFₐ/Fₑ = (nₑ - 1)/(nₐ - 1), (8.2.2)\nwhere we have allowed for the fact that the radii of curvature of both lenses are the same. Formula (8.2.1) can be transformed thus:\nf₂ = f₁F / (f₁ - F).\nOn the curve representing the f₂ vs. f₁ dependence, the value of F is determined by the position of the vertical asymptote of each curve. However, a more exact value can be obtained by drawing a straight line that passes through the origin at an angle of 45° to the axes. In this case the coordinates of the points of intersection of this straight line with the curves yield f₂ = f₁ = 2F for both lenses, while the ratios of these coordinates determine, via formula (8.2.2), the ratio of nₑ - 1 to nₐ - 1."

    "Questions": "When taking a picture of a group of objects that are positioned at different distances from the camera, one must allow for the so-called depth of focus, or the limits of the greatest and the smallest distance between which the image is sharp for a given focus setting of the camera. Why is the depth of focus the greater the smaller the aperture setting?",
    "Answers": "The smaller the aperture, the lower the optical distortions caused by the large width of the beam of light incident on the lenses of the objective. If the aperture is very small, the optical properties of the camera closely resemble those of a pinhole camera, whose aperture, in terms of geometrical optics, can be as small as desired and whose depth of focus extends from zero to infinity. Actually, however, diffraction imposes certain restrictions on this ideal case. The limiting value of the diameter of the aperture, D, is determined by the wavelength of the light and by the distance from the aperture to the photographic plate. Theoretical considerations suggest that D must be close to the value for which only one Fresnel zone fits into the aperture:*\nD ≈ √4λf.\nFor instance, at λ ≈ 0.5 μm and f ≈ 5 cm, the diameter of the aperture is approximately 0.6 mm. Note that in photography the size of the aperture is characterized by a quantity known as the aperture ratio, or the ratio of the diameter of the aperture to the focal length. Usually the aperture ratio is marked by a fraction whose numerator is unity (1/4.5, 1/5.6, 1/8, 1/11). In the example we are discussing here the aperture ratio is equal to 1/80. In cameras the smallest aperture ratio is practically never less than 1/16, so that diffraction effects play no role in the present problem and need not be taken into account.\n\n* According to Rayleigh, the sharpest focus in a pinhole camera is achieved when the radius of the aperture is 0.95 of the radius of the zeroth Fresnel zone."

    "Answers": "A ray that enters the rod at an angle α, travels in the glass after being refracted at an angle β given by Snell's law:\nsin β = n⁻¹ sin α. (8.5.1)\nThe ray falls on the lateral face of the rod at an angle that is not smaller than the critical angle. From the figure accompanying the problem it follows that this angle is π/2 - β. According to the critical angle condition,\nsin(π/2 - β) = cos β ≥ n⁻¹. (8.5.2)\nThe maximal value of β at α = π/2, according to (8.5.1), obeys the condition\nsin β = 1/n. (8.5.3)\nSquaring (8.5.2) and (8.5.3) and adding the squares, we get\n1 ≥ 2/n²,\nwhence\nn ≥ √2.\nThe phenomenon of light “trapping” in a glass rod is widely used in fiber optics. If the attenuation of light in the glass is low, the ray can travel over great distances. Bundles of such rods (or fibers) form cables over which data can be transmitted with a high accuracy and a low level of noise. Internal organs of human beings can be illuminated with the light transmitted by such fibers, which at present is widely used in medical practice for diagnostic purposes."

Is a prism suitable for this purpose? (See Fig. 8.6)",
    "Answers": "The figure accompanying the problem shows that after reflection from the first mirror the beam changes its direction by an angle of 2α, while after reflection from the second mirror the beam changes its direction by an additional angle of 2β. For the refracted beam to travel in the direction opposite to the direction of the incident beam, the sum 2α + 2β must be equal to π, or α + β = π/2.\nIn this case the angle between the normals to the mirrors is\nθ = π - (α + β) = π/2.\nThe angle between the mirrors must also be equal to π/2.\nIf instead of the two mirrors we take a prism (see Figure (a) accompanying the answer), then a beam incident on the base of the prism at an angle α will enter the prism at an angle β determined by Snell's law. For the refracted beam to leave the prism in the direction opposite to the one of the incident beam after undergoing total internal reflection from the lateral surfaces of the prism, the beam must fall on the base of the prism (after it has been reflected by the second lateral surface) at an angle β. Figure (a) accompanying the answer shows that the beam travels the same path as in the case of two mirrors, whereby the angle at the apex of the prism must be equal to π/2. We see that a prism may also be used to reverse a beam. For the beam to retain its energy after traveling through the prism practically for all angles of incidence, the lateral surfaces of the prism must be metalized. If three flat mirrors are positioned at right angles, as shown in Figure (b) accompanying the answer, it can be demonstrated that the beam of light may be oriented with respect to the first mirror (on which it is incident) in an arbitrary manner and yet the refracted beam will always be parallel to the incident one. Instead of three mirrors we can use a glass tetrahedron with a right trihedral angle at the apex and identical metalized lateral surfaces in the form of right isosceles triangles (see Figure (c) accompanying the answer). A beam incident on the base of the tetrahedron is reflected by the metalized surfaces and leaves the tetrahedron through the base in the direction opposite but parallel to the one of the incident beam.

    "Answers": "When light is reflected from the upper boundary of each film, the phase of the wave changes to the opposite or, as it is usually said, a half-wave is lost. The light that passes through the film is reflected by the substrate, which in one case has a refractive index greater than that of the film and in the other, smaller than that of the film. When n₂ > n, a new change in the phase of the reflected wave to the opposite one occurs, while when n₁ < n, the phase of the reflected wave is retained.

    "Answers": "Interference is caused by the difference in paths of the light rays that forms in the space between the lens and the cylinder. The interference fringes constitute bands of equal width.\nLet us introduce a system of coordinates. One axis, the x axis, is directed along the generator of the cylinder that passes through the point at which the lens touches the cylinder, while the second axis, the y axis, is at right angles to the generator discussed above (see Figure (a) accompanying the answer). We draw a plane that is perpendicular to the x axis and passes at a distance y from the origin. Figure (b) shows the section of the lens by the plane (curve 1) and the section of the cylinder by the plane (curve 2). The same figure demonstrates the section of the lens by a plane that is perpendicular to the x axis and intersects the lens along its diameter (dashed curve 3). From Figure (b) it also follows that the gap between the lens and the cylinder is\nh = h₁ - h₂ = r²/2R₁ - y²/2R₂ = (x²+y²)/2R₁ - y²/2R₂.\nHere, as usual, we assume the following approximations to be valid:\nr = √2R₁h, y = √2R₂h.\nAfter carrying out the appropriate transformations we get\nx²/2R₁h + y²/2h(1/R₁ - 1/R₂)⁻¹ = 1. (8.14.1)\nIf we introduce the notation a² = 2R₁h and b² = 2hR₁R₂/(R₂ - R₁), then (8.14.1) assumes the form\nx²/a² + y²/b² = 1.\nThe interference fringes have the shape of ellipses (see Figure (c) accompanying the answer) in which h is a parameter.

    "Answers": "The section of the cylinder segment by a plane parallel to the plane of the drawing is everywhere the same. For this reason, all points that have the same path difference for the ray reflected from the lower surface of the cylinder and the ray reflected from the upper surface of the plate lie at the same distance from the cylinder's generator that touches the plate, with the result that the interference fringes are in the form of straight lines parallel to the generator. The method of determining the distances between the sequential fringes closely resembles the method of determining the radii of Newton rings. The distances from the generator that touches the plate satisfy the same conditions as the radii of Newton rings do, namely,\nh = √Rλ(k+1/2)\nfor bright bands in reflected light and dark bands in transmitted light, and\nh = √Rλk\nfor dark bands in reflected light and bright bands in transmitted light.

    "Answers": "The width of the air gap between the lens and the plate is the sum of the thickness of the lens section and the particle thickness:\nh = h₀ + a = r²/2R + a,\nwhere r is the radius of the ring being observed. A bright ring whose number is k is observed at\nh = (2k-1)λ/2.\nThus,\nr² = (2k-1)λR/2 - 2Ra.\nIf the numbers of sequential rings are laid off on the horizontal axis and the square of the radii of the corresponding rings, on the vertical axis, we obtain a straight line (see the figure accompanying the answer) whose slope is equal to the ratio of the difference of squares of radii of two neighboring rings to the product λR, that is, (rₖ² - rₖ₋₁²)/λR. Knowing R, we can find λ. Note that in this method there is no difference between bright and dark rings, and knowing the exact number of a ring is not necessary.

Assuming that the angles α and θ are small, sketch the positions of the interference fringes. The size of the wavelength is shown in the figure. (See Fig. 8.17)",

The points at which these straight lines intersect the substrate (including the surface of the ledge) determine the position of the interference fringes of equal width. Analyzing the position of the fringes obtained here, one can establish that from the wider side of the wedge (in the figure accompanying the problem, on the right) the distance between the fringes, or bands, is smaller (for any value of θ) than over the flat sections of the substrate. The distance between the fringes from the narrow side of the wedge (on the left) can be either smaller or greater than the distance over the flat sections depending on the relationship between θ and α. For\nθ > α (see Figure (a) accompanying the answer),\nθ = α + β.\nThe left side of the ledge acts as a substrate and forms an angle β with the plate, that is, a wedge. If θ > 2α, then β > α and the distance between the fringes is smaller than that between the fringes over the flat section of the plate. This case is depicted in Figure (b) and corresponds to the case depicted in the figure accompanying the problem. But if θ < 2α, we have β < α and the fringes above the left side of the wedge are separated by a distance greater than that separating the fringes over the flat section of the plate. For θ < α (see Figure (c) accompanying the answer), the left side of the wedge also acts as a substrate and forms a wedge with an angle β < α with the plate.

For this reason, at the points of a ledge the path difference is the same as at the points of the wedge closer to the narrow part of the gap, while at the points of a dent the difference is the same as at points closer to the wide part of the gap.

(See Fig. 8.19)",
    "Answers": "The illumination at the center of the second screen is determined by the number of Fresnel zones into which the section of the wave surface limited by the hole in the first screen can be partitioned. If this number is not large and is even, the light is practically absent from the center, while if the number is odd, light is observed at the center. If a is the diameter of the hole, λ is the wavelength of the incident light, and z is the distance between the screens, the number of Fresnel zones is determined by the expression\nk = a²/4λz.\nAs the distance between the screens is increased, the number of zones assumes alternately odd and even values, and this is accompanied by an increase or a decrease in the illumination at the center of the diffraction pattern. Since the number of zones continuously decreases as z gets larger and larger, the limit distance is the one at which k becomes equal to unity, that is,\nz = a²/4λ.\nAt a distance greater than this value, the intensity decreases monotonically, and for z >> a²/4λ the intensity changes in inverse proportion to z², that is, just like for a point source."

Can it be possible that under such conditions the geometric shadow on the screen contains a bright spot in its center? (See Fig. 8.20)",
    "Answers": "When the central Fresnel zone and several neighboring zones are screened, the light intensity at the center of the geometric shadow is exactly the same as if one-half of the first nonscreened zones was acting. The calculation is carried out in the same manner as when there is no obstacle, the only difference being that the calculation of the overall action of the Fresnel zones starts not from the zeroth (or central) zone but from the first nonscreened zone. Therefore, a bright spot is always observed at the center of the screen irrespective of the distance to the obstacle or of the wavelength of the light wave (the only requirement is that the number of zones screened by the obstacle be moderate).\nA theoretical description of the formation of a bright spot at the center of the geometric shadow was first carried out by Poisson, who used it as an objection against the wave theory of light, since he assumed that such a spot could simply not exist. But an experiment carried out by Arago proved without doubt that such a spot does indeed exist. Actually, this spot was discovered roughly a hundred years earlier by Maraldi.

    "Questions": "A parallel beam of light falls at an angle θ on a flat diffraction grating with a spacing d. Determine the fundamental grating condition for the wavelength λ, the maximum order of the spectrum in which the appropriate spectral line can be observed, the maximum wavelength for which a line in the spectrum can be resolved, and the maximum dispersive power of the grating?",
    "Answers": "The path difference between the rays from two neighboring slits is determined, as illustrated by the figure accompanying the answer, for direction 1 by the difference between the segments AB and CD₁ and for direction 2, by the difference between AB and CD₂. Accordingly, the path differences for directions 1 and 2 are\nδ₁ = d(sinθ - sinφ₁) and δ₂ = d(sinφ₂ - sinθ),\nor\nδ₁ = 2dcos((θ+φ₁)/2)sin((θ-φ₁)/2),\nδ₂ = 2dcos((φ₂+θ)/2)sin((φ₂-θ)/2).\nThus, the diffraction maximum conditions can be written thus:\n2dcos((θ+φ₁)/2)sin((θ-φ₁)/2) = kλ,\n2dcos((φ₂+θ)/2)sin((φ₂-θ)/2) = kλ.\nIn the first approximation we can assume that θ+φ₁ ≈ φ₂+θ ≈ 2θ. Hence,\ndcosθ × (θ - φ₁) ≈ kλ, dcosθ × (φ₂ - θ) ≈ kλ. (8.25.1)\nThis formulas have the same form as for the case of normal incidence of light on a grating with spacing dcosθ. The maximum order of the spectrum in which the wavelength λ is observed is\nk = dcosθ/λ,\nwhile the longest wavelength (k=1) is\nλ = dcosθ.\nThe dispersive power can be conveniently expressed in terms of the angle with respect to the direction of the zeroth maximum, θ - φ₁ and φ₂ - θ. If by ψ we denote these differences, which are close in absolute value, we find that\ndψ/dλ ≈ k/(dcosθcosψ).\nAt angles θ close to 90°, the dispersive power of the grating may be considerably higher than for normal incidence of light on the grating. However, the maximum dispersive power is 1/λcosψ, just as for normal incidence."

    "Answers": "According to Brewster's law, when light is reflected from a dielectric, complete polarization occurs when the tangent of the angle of incidence is equal to the refractive index of the medium reflecting the light. Since when light propagates in air and falls on a dielectric the refractive index is always greater than unity, we have tan α > 1, or α > 45°."

Light that is practically completely polarized can be obtained if one uses a stack (see the figure accompanying the answer) of parallel plates whose surfaces are oriented at the Brewster angle to the incident light.

In the first case (see Figure (a) accompanying the problem) the optic axis is parallel to the crystal boundary, while in the other (Figure (b)) it is perpendicular to the boundary.

What is the intensity I of the light that has travelled this path? (See Fig. 8.32)",
    "Answers": "After the light has passed through the first Nicol prism, its intensity becomes I₁ = (1/2)I₀ (it is assumed that the extraordinary wave loses no intensity when it is reflected and when it travels through a Nicol prism). According to Malus' law, after the light has passed through the second Nicol prism the intensity becomes\nI₂ = I₁cos²θ = (1/2)I₀cos²θ.\nThe figure accompanying the answer shows the direction of oscillations of the electromagnetic field vector in the electromagnetic wave after the wave has passed through the first Nicol prism, E₁, and after the wave has passed through the second Nicol prism, E₂. In the reverse direction the electric field vector will be retained after the reflected wave has passed through the first Nicol prism but will change to E₂cosθ after the wave has passed through the second Nicol prism.

The result is the so-called Faraday effect (rotation of the polarization plane in a magnetic field). After passing through the substance (and magnetic field), the light is reflected by a mirror and travels in the opposite direction, whereby it travels through the magnetic field once more but in the opposite direction. Will the angle of rotation of the polarization plane be doubled or will it cancel itself out? (See Fig. 8.33)",
    "Answers": "The sense of rotation of the polarization plane depends on the direction of propagation of light in relation to the direction of the external magnetic field. For an overwhelming majority of substances (“positive” substances), the rotation is clockwise (looking in the direction of the ray of light) if the direction of propagation of light corresponds with that of the external magnetic field, and counterclockwise if the two directions are opposite. If the directions of the light ray and the external magnetic field coincided when the light passed from the source to the mirror and, therefore, the polarization plane rotated clockwise, after the light is reflected by the mirror the directions of the light ray and the external magnetic field are in opposition and the polarization plane rotates counterclockwise. If one views this process from the mirror, the rotation sense coincides with the clockwise rotation of the polarization plane when light passes in the primary direction. As a result, the two rotations are added and the angle doubles."

The phenomenon, known as the Kerr effect, can be observed via two crossed Nicol prisms. Does the observed pattern change if the direction of the electric field is reversed? (See Fig. 8.34)",
    "Answers": "In the Kerr effect, the difference of the refractive indices of the extraordinary and ordinary waves obeys the law\nnₑ - nₒ = kE², (8.34.1)\nwhere k is a constant characterizing the medium. Since the electric field strength is squared in (8.34.1), the difference nₑ - nₒ does not depend on the direction of the electric field.

The path difference between the ordinary and extraordinary rays,\nδ = l(nₑ - nₒ) = kE²l\n(l is the length of the light path in the nitrobenzene), is also independent of the direction of the electric field vector, whereby the optical pattern caused by the emerging elliptical polarization will not change under reversal of direction of electric field."

Which curve corresponds to which theory? (See Fig. 8.35)",
    "Answers": "According to classical theory, when a source of electromagnetic waves moves toward the observer, the ratio of the perceptible frequency to the frequency of the light emitted by a fixed source is\nν_cl/ν₀ = 1/(1-β),\nwith β the ratio of the speed of the source to the speed of light. According to the theory of relativity, this frequency ratio does not depend on whether the source or the observer is considered fixed and\nν_t.r/ν₀ = √((1+β)/(1-β)).\nThe ν_t.r-to-ν_cl ratio is given by the formula\nν_t.r/ν_cl = √(1-β²).\nHence, the upper curve corresponds to classical-theory results, while the lower curve corresponds to the theory-of-relativity results.

The measurements are carried out in two directions, counter to the direction of motion of the ions and “in pursuit” of the ions. The measured wavelengths are λ₁ and λ₂, respectively. Can we employ the classical formulas of the Doppler effect or must we use the relativistic formulas? The ion velocities range from 10⁴ to 10⁵ m/s.",
    "Answers": "The ratio of the ion velocity to the speed of light, β = v/c, in the case at hand is of the order of 10⁻⁴. For such values of β the difference between the classical and relativistic formulas for the Doppler effect is negligible. If the source moves with a velocity v, the wavelength of the light measured by the receiver is\nλ = λ₀ ± vT = λ₀(1 ± v/c).\nHere λ₀ is the wavelength of the light emitted by a fixed source, and the plus sign corresponds to the case where the source is moving away from the receiver, while the minus sign corresponds to the case where the source is moving toward the receiver. The difference in wavelengths measured from both sides of the tube with the plasma in which the ions move is\nΔλ = 2λ₀(v/c),\nwhich yields the following formula for the velocity of the ions:\nv = (Δλ/2λ₀)c.\nSince the ions have different velocities, each observed spectral line is blurred, or broadened. The maximal intensity corresponds to the most probable velocity, while the extent to which the line is blurred characterizes the velocity distribution of the directional motion of the ions."

Which curve corresponds to a higher temperature? (See Fig. 8.37)",
    "Answers": "Since the velocities of atoms are much lower than the speed of light, we can employ the classical formulas for the Doppler effect. As shown in the answer to Problem 8.36, the difference in the wavelengths of the waves emitted by two identical sources that move with velocities of the same absolute value but pointing in opposite directions in relation to the receiver constitutes\nΔλ = 2λ₀(v/c),\nwhere λ₀ is the wavelength of the wave emitted by a fixed source, and c is the speed of light. In a light-emitting gas, the atoms move with different velocities, in accordance with the Maxwellian distribution law.

The wavelength distribution of the intensity of the radiation for one spectral line is shown in Figure (b). Can analyzing this distribution yield the temperature of the ions? (See Fig. 8.38)",
    "Answers": "In accord with the Doppler principle, the distribution in wavelengths of the intensity of the emission lines of excited ions reflects the velocity distribution of the ions (and hence the energy distribution of the ions, too). However, this distribution cannot be associated with the temperature of the gas. The fact is that the motion of ions in the discharge plasma (which is the source of radiation emitted in the tube) is highly anisotropic; this anisotropy is determined by the electric field strength in the tube. The electric field in the tube has a radial component directed from the axis to the wall. On the axis this component is zero; it increases as we approach the wall. This field imparts a directional velocity to the ions. Thus, the left half of the curve in Figure (b) (shorter wavelengths) corresponds to the ions moving away from the axis toward the spectrograph, while the right half corresponds to the ions moving away from the axis in the opposite direction."

    "Answers": "Let us assume that such radiation has been obtained and is directed onto a mirror that is a paraboloid of revolution, with the rays of light being strictly parallel to the axis of the paraboloid (see the figure accompanying the answer). Since planes that are perpendicular to the rays are wave surfaces, all points in a single plane are in the same phase of oscillation (irrespective of the nature of the oscillation). All rays parallel to the axis converge (after being reflected) at a geometric point that is the focus of the paraboloid. The geometrical properties of a parabola imply that the sum of distances from any point in a plane that is perpendicular to the axis to the parabola and from the parabola to the focus is a constant. This means that the oscillations that arrive at the focus from all points in a wave surface are in phase. Hence, all radiation that travels to the paraboloid will be concentrated at a single point and the volume energy density of the radiation will become infinite at that point. This would make it possible to obtain (theoretically) infinite local temperatures at a finite temperature of the radiation source that provides the flow of plane waves.\nThe picture can be reversed, that is, we may ask ourselves: what requirements must a source meet for it to produce a stream of plane waves? Taking into account the reversibility of light rays, we conclude that such a source must be concentrated at a geometric point. At present quantum electronics can produce radiation with extremely low angular divergence, something on the order of 10⁻² or even 10⁻³ of one second of the arc and, respectively, with colossal local power outputs. But even in this case the rays in such radiation cannot be considered strictly parallel."

    "Questions": "The energy distribution function for photoelectrons has the form shown in the figure. What determines the maximal energy of the photoelectrons?",
    "Answers": "The photon energy transferred to an electron in the metal is used to overcome the potential barrier at the boundary of the metal (the work function P) and part of it is lost inside the metal. In addition, one must bear in mind that not only the electrons that occupy levels lying near the Fermi level participate in the photoeffect. In addition to these, there are electrons that move somewhat slower and, hence, require for their liberation energies greater than the external work function. Therefore, Einstein's equation can be written in the form\nhν = A + P + W,\nwhere A is the term characterizing the energy losses inside the metal and the additional energy necessary for the electrons lying below the Fermi level to become liberated. The photoelectrons that escape from the surface of the metal have the maximal energy (A = 0); the initial energy of such electrons corresponds to the Fermi level:\nW_m = hν - P."

    "Questions": "In the Lukirskii-Prilezhaev experiments (also conducted independently by R. A. Millikan), the dependence of the stopping potential U_stop, that is, the potential needed to stop the photocurrent in a photocell and the associated electric circuit, on the frequency of the light incident on the surface of the photocell is depicted by straight lines. How to find the Planck constant knowing the slope of these straight lines? In what respect do the parameters that characterize these two straight lines differ? (See Fig. 8.52)",
    "Answers": "According to Einstein's equation,\nhν = P + mv_m²/2,\nwhere W_m is the maximal energy of the photoelectrons, and P is the work function of electrons ejected by the cathode. To stop the photoelectron current, we must apply a stopping potential no smaller than U_stop, which is determined from the equation\nmv_m²/2 = eU_stop,\nwhere e is the electron charge. Thus,\nhν = P + eU_stop.\nFor a known value of e, the slope of the straight lines, dU_stop/dν = h/e, determines the Planck constant. The straight lines are different because they correspond to cathodes with different work functions. The work function can be determined either by the point of intersection of a straight line (for a particular cathode) with the horizontal axis,\nP = hν₀\n(with ν₀ the photoelectric threshold), or by the point of intersection of the straight line with the vertical axis,\nP = -eU_stop₀."

    "Questions": "Two electrodes placed in a vacuum at a certain distance from each other are connected electrically by a resistor. One electrode is illuminated with light from a source whose spectrum contains radiation with a wavelength λ that satisfies the condition hc/λ > P, where P is the work function of electrons leaving the metal of the illuminated electrode. Will there be any current in this circuit? (See Fig. 8.53)",
    "Answers": "According to the hypothesis, the illuminated electrode emits photoelectrons whose maximal energy is\nW_m = hc/λ - P,\nwhich makes it possible to think of the system as an emf source, with the maximal value of the emf being\nε = W_m/e. (8.53.1)\nThis source can generate a current in the circuit; the current is determined by the intensity of illumination of the electrode but cannot exceed a value of\nI_m = ε/R.\nAt the same time, the current cannot exceed the value\nI = Ne,\nwhere N is the number of electrons ejected by the cathode per unit time due to illumination of the cathode with light. Since according to (8.53.1) the emf is constant and so is the value of R, the interelectrode gap may be considered as a resistance r_vac whose value is the smaller the greater the intensity of the light. In darkness this resistance is infinite. Bearing all this in mind, we can write\nI = ε/(R + r_vac)."

    "Questions": "A photocathode can be illuminated by the light from two sources, each of which emits monochromatic radiation. The sources are positioned at equal distances from the photocathode. The dependence of the photocurrent on the voltage between the cathode and the anode is depicted by curve 1 for one source and by curve 2 for the other. In what respect do these sources differ? (See Fig. 8.54)",
    "Answers": "The stopping potential difference, that is the voltage at which the photocurrent ceases, is the same for both cases. This potential difference determines the maximal photoelectron energy and equals the difference between the photon energy and the work function; hence, the emission frequency for the two sources is the same, and the sources differ only in the intensity of the radiation they emit."

The dependence of the photocurrent on the voltage between the cathode and the anode is depicted by curve 1 for one cathode and by curve 2 for the other. What photocathode has a higher work function? (See Fig. 8.55)",
    "Answers": "According to Einstein's formula, the work function is equal to the difference between the photon energy and the maximal kinetic energy of the photoelectrons:\nP = hν - mv_m²/2.\nThe higher the maximal energy of the photoelectrons, which energy is equal to the maximal stopping potential, the lower the work function. In the case at hand, the cathode whose current-voltage characteristic is represented by curve 2 has a higher work function."

    "Questions": "The stopping potential applied between a photocathode and the respective anode is such that the fastest photoelectrons can fly only one-half of the distance between the cathode and the anode. Will the electrons be able to reach the anode if the distance between the cathode and the anode is reduced by half but the voltage is kept constant?",
    "Answers": "The point that an electron can reach thanks to their initial kinetic energy is determined only by the value of the stopping potential difference. Irrespective of the distance between the electrodes, the point is always at the middle of the interelectrode gap, and only such a distance can the fastest electrons leaving the cathode cover."

    "Questions": "In one case of Compton scattering a photon flies at an angle θ₁ to the initial direction of the incident photons, and in other case it flies at an angle θ₂. In which case is the wavelength of the radiation after scattering greater, and in which case does the electron participating in the interaction receive a greater portion of energy? (See Fig. 8.57)",
    "Answers": "In Compton scattering, the photon wavelength changes by\nΔλ = (h/mₑc)(1 - cosθ).\nWe see that in the case of angle θ₂ the wavelength increases by a larger quantity. Hence, hν₂ < hν₁. As a result of scattering, the photon transfers a fraction of its energy to the electron, and the energy that the electron receives is the greater, the smaller the energy of the photon after scattering, and hence the greater the value of θ is."
