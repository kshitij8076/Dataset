The hinges are frictionless. The moment of inertia of the laminar sheet about an axis parallel to AB and passing through its centre of mass is I = 1.2 kg·m². Two rubber obstacles P and Q are fixed, one on each metallic plate at a distance 0.5 m from the line AB. This distance is chosen, so that the reaction due to the hinges on the laminar sheet is zero during the impact. Initially the laminar sheet hits one of the obstacles with an angular velocity 1 rad/s and turns back. If the impulse on the sheet due to each obstacle is 6 N·s.",
