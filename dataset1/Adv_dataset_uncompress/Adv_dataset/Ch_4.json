It stops due to friction between the block and the surface after moving through a certain distance. The surface is now tilted to an angle of 30° with the horizontal and the same block is made to go up on the surface with the same initial velocity v. The decrease in the mechanical energy in the second situation is smaller than that in the first situation. Reason: The coefficient of friction between the block and the surface decreases with the increase in the angle of inclination.",
