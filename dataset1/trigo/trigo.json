If k=2, sin(π/n)=1/2, so π/n=π/6, n=6. For k > 2, arcsin(1/k) is not a rational multiple of π (from Baker's theorem on linear forms in logarithms), so n would not be an integer. Thus, the only solution is n=6."

The roots are t₁=tan(α/2) and t₂=tan(β/2). The sum of roots t₁+t₂ = 2b/(a+c) and product t₁t₂ = (c-a)/(a+c). tan((α+β)/2) = (tan(α/2)+tan(β/2))/(1-tan(α/2)tan(β/2)) = (t₁+t₂)/(1-t₁t₂).

No. The solution is `y(x) = 1 - (1/2)sin²(x)`. No, that's not it. Let's try reduction of order. One solution is `y1 = sin(x)`. `y1' = cos(x)`, `y1''=-sin(x)`. `-sin - tan*cos + 2sin = 0`. So `y1=sin(x)` is a solution. Let `y2=v*sin(x)`. After substitution, we solve for v, `v = integral of cos(x)`. So `y2=sin²(x)`. The general solution is `A*sin(x) + B*sin²(x)`.

    "Question": "How many times does the graph of y = cos(x) intersect the graph of y = log₁₀(x) for x>0?",
    "Solution": "log₁₀(x) is monotonically increasing. It is negative for x<1 and positive for x>1. cos(x) oscillates between -1 and 1. They intersect once for x in (0,1]. For x>1, log₁₀(x) increases slowly. It will cross the cos(x) curve once in each interval [2kπ-π/2, 2kπ+π/2] as long as log₁₀(x)≤1. This happens for x≤10. So it crosses for k=1 (2π), k=2(4π).. wait k=1 at 2π is ~6.28, log(6.28)<1. k=2 no. So in [0, 2π], we get 1 crossing. In [2π,4π] log10(x) > 1. Total crossings = 3."

    "Question": "In number theory, what is the 'class number' of a number field and how does it relate to trigonometry?",
    "Solution": "The class number measures the failure of unique factorization in the ring of integers of a number field.

    "Solution": "Area = n (s²/4)cot(π/n) = 17/4 * cot(π/17). cos(π/17) and sin(π/17) are constructible, so cot(π/17) has an explicit (but extremely long) form in terms of nested square roots."

    "Question": "What is the relation between the sides of a triangle if the line joining the Spieker center and the symmedian point is parallel to BC?",

    "Question": "In financial modeling, the Heston model for stochastic volatility includes a correlation parameter ρ between the stock price and its volatility. What effect does ρ<0 have on the implied volatility smile?",
    "Solution": "A negative correlation (leverage effect) means volatility tends to rise when the stock price falls. This creates a 'smirk' or skew in the implied volatility smile, where out-of-the-money puts have higher implied volatility than out-of-the-money calls."

    "Question": "What is the relation between the zeta function of a variety over a finite field and the number of points on it?",
    "Solution": "The zeta function Z(X,t) is a power series whose coefficients are related to the number of points on the variety over finite field extensions. The Weil conjectures (proven by Deligne) relate the properties of this zeta function to the topology of the variety, including a functional equation and a 'Riemann hypothesis'."

    "Question": "The BCS theory of superconductivity predicts a ground state wavefunction which is a superposition of what kind of states?",
    "Solution": "The BCS ground state is a coherent superposition of Cooper pairs, which are bound states of two electrons with opposite momentum and spin. It is given by |BCS> = ∏_k (u_k + v_k c†_{k↑}c†_{-k↓})|0>, where u_k²+v_k²=1 can be parametrized by a trigonometric function."

    "Question": "Evaluate ∫_0^π/2 cos(2x)cos(4x) dx.",
    "Solution": "Use product-to-sum: (1/2)∫(cos(6x)+cos(2x))dx = (1/2)[sin(6x)/6+sin(2x)/2]_0^π/2 = 0."

    "id": 1744,
    "Question": "Let a be an irrational number. Is the set {sin(n a π) | n∈Z} dense in [-1,1]?",
    "Solution": "Yes. This is a consequence of the Kronecker approximation theorem (or Weyl's criterion on equidistribution). Since a is irrational, the set of {na mod 2} is dense in [0,2]. By continuity of sine, the image is dense in [-1,1]."

    "Question": "Find ∫∫∫_V z dV where V is bounded by z=x²+y² and z=1.",
    "Solution": "The volume is a paraboloid. Use cylindrical coordinates. ∫_0^{2π}∫_0^1∫_{r²}^1 z r dz dr dθ. Inner integral: (1-r⁴)/2. Middle integral: ∫(r-r⁵)/2 dr = [r²/4-r⁶/12]_0^1=1/6. Total integral is 2π*(1/6)=π/3."

  {
    "id": 1746,
    "Question": "In renormalization group theory, what is a fixed point of the beta function?",
    "Solution": "A fixed point, where β(g)=0, represents a scale-invariant theory. If the fixed point is attractive (IR fixed point), it describes the long-distance physics. If it's repulsive (UV fixed point), it describes the short-distance physics. A theory with a UV fixed point is 'asymptotically safe'."

    "id": 1747,
    "Question": "If G is the group O(n), the group of n x n orthogonal matrices, what is its dimension?",
    "Solution": "The Lie algebra consists of n x n anti-symmetric matrices. The dimension of this space is the number of entries above the diagonal, which is n(n-1)/2."

    "id": 1748,
    "Question": "What is the relation between the sides of a triangle whose circumcenter, incenter, and one vertex are collinear?",
    "Solution": "If O, I, and A are collinear, this implies the angle bisector of A is also the median and altitude. This means the triangle is isosceles with b=c."

  {
    "id": 149,
    "Question": "Find all integer n such that cos(2π/n) is an algebraic number of degree at most 2 over ℚ.",
    "Solution": "The degree of the field extension Q(cos(2π/n)) is φ(n)/2. We need φ(n)/2 ≤ 2, so φ(n)≤4. n can be 1,2,3,4,5,6,8,10,12."

  {
    "id": 1750,
    "Question": "If A,B are Hermitian, the Golden-Thompson inequality states Tr(e^{A+B}) ≤ Tr(e^A e^B). Is there a trigonometric analogue?",
    "Solution": "This is a deep matrix analysis result. A trigonometric analogue is not standard, but one might exist in the context of matrix trig functions if one defines them appropriately, though it's not a widely known result."
