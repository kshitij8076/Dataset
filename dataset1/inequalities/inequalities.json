    "Solution": "Observe that Σ_cyc (a³-b³)/(a²+ab+b²) = Σ_cyc (a-b) = 0. Thus, the LHS is equal to Σ_cyc b³/(a²+ab+b²). The inequality becomes Σ_cyc (a³+b³)/(a²+ab+b²) ≥ 2(a+b+c)/3. This is implied by (a³+b³)/(a²+ab+b²) = (a+b)(a²-ab+b²)/(a²+ab+b²) ≥ (a+b)/3, which simplifies to (a-b)² ≥ 0."

Apply Jensen's inequality for a cleverly chosen function, or use a tangent line trick at a=b=c=1 for the function f(x)=x/( (3-x-z)²+1) which is extremely complex. The simpler Σ a/(bc+1) ≥ 3/2 is also non-trivial and requires substitution and C-S."

The inequality is pq-r ≥ 4(p-1). This is equivalent to pq-1 ≥ 4p-4. By Schur's inequality, p³+9r ≥ 4pq, so p³+9 ≥ 4pq. We must prove (p³+9)/p ≥ 4p-4, which is a difficult one-variable inequality."

To prove with 2, rewrite the sum by changing order of summation: Σ_{k=1 to N} a_k Σ_{n=k to N} 1/n. Bounding the inner sum by 1 + ln(N/k) does not work easily.

Use the AM-GM trick: ab/( (a+c)+(b+c) ) ≤ ab * (1/4) * (1/(a+c) + 1/(b+c)). Summing this over the cycle leads to a telescoping sum or a simpler structure that can be bounded."

Since tan(x) is convex on (0,π/2), Jensen's inequality applies: (ΣtanA)/3 ≥ tan(ΣA/3)=tan(π/3)=√3. Thus ΣtanA ≥ 3√3. If the triangle is obtuse, one tan is negative, and the sum can be small."

    "Solution": "The standard proof works for r=1. For r≥0, assume a≥b≥c. The expression is (a-b)(a^r(a-c)-b^r(b-c)) + c^r(c-a)(c-b). The second term is non-negative. The first term's sign depends on a^r(a-c) vs b^r(b-c). Since a>b and a-c>b-c, the term is non-negative, proving the inequality."

    "Solution": "This is Bernoulli's inequality generalized. Proof by induction. For n=2, (1-x₁)(1-x₂) = 1-x₁-x₂+x₁x₂ ≥ 1-x₁-x₂ since x₁x₂≥0. Assume for n. Π_{i=1 to n+1}(1-x_i) ≥ (1-Σ_{i=1 to n} x_i)(1-x_{n+1}). This expands to 1-Σx_i - x_{n+1} + x_{n+1}Σx_i ≥ 1-Σ_{i=1 to n+1}x_i."

    "Solution": "This is a very hard symmetric inequality. It's equivalent to showing Σa⁴+Σa²bc-2Σa²b² ≥ 0. This can be proven by expressing it as a sum of squares, but the decomposition is not obvious. One SOS form is Σ_cyc (a²-b²)² + (a-b)²(a-c)²(b-c)² ?? This needs advanced p,q,r methods or computer algebra."

    "Solution": "Use the identity a³/(a²+c²) = a - ac²/(a²+c²). Sum is Σa - Σac²/(a²+c²). Using 2xy≤x²+y², we have ac²/(a²+c²) ≤ ac²/(2ac)=c/2. So Σac²/(a²+c²) ≤ Σc/2. LHS ≥ Σa - Σc/2 = (a+b+c)/2."

So (Σa_i³)² ≤ (Σa_i²)(Σa_i⁶). Not useful. Use C-S on u=(a_1,...) and v=(a_1^(3/2), ...)? Let u_i = a_i^(1/2) and v_i = a_i^(3/2). Then (Σa_i²)² ≤ (Σa_i)(Σa_i³)."

    "Solution": "For n=2, 2^π ≈ 2³.¹⁴ vs π² ≈ 3.14². 8*... vs 9.8... so 2^π < π². False. Let's check f(x)=ln(x)/x. It's maximum is at x=e. For x>e, it's decreasing. We are comparing ln(n)/n with ln(π)/π. Since 3<π<4 and e<3, the function is decreasing in this range. We need to check if n/ln(n) vs π/ln(π). f(3)>f(4). So ln(3)/3 > ln(4)/4 -> 4ln3 > 3ln4 -> ln(81)>ln(64). So 3⁴>4³. So for n=3 it holds. For n=4, 4/ln4 vs π/lnπ. Comparing f(π) and f(4). Since 4>π>e, f(π)>f(4). So lnπ/π>ln4/4. 4lnπ>πln4. π⁴>4^π."

This is not helpful. We need to use convexity of f(x)=xlnx with weights a,b,c themselves. (a/(a+b+c))f(a)+.. is not correct either. This is Jensen's for f(x)=xlnx with weights proportional to the variables."

The joint PDF is (1/2π)exp(-(x²+y²)/2). Using polar coordinates simplifies the integral, and differentiating the resulting CDF gives the Cauchy PDF, 1/(π(1+z²))."

One proof method is to assume one variable is large and others small and analyze the boundary cases, combined with a convexity-type argument for the interior."
