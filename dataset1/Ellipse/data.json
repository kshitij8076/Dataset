      "Answers": "Let the circle S₂ having centre at C₂ and radius r₂ lie completely inside the circle S₁ having centre at C₁ and radius r₁. A variable circle S with center C and radius 'r' touches S₁ internally and S₂ externally. From the geometry, the distance between the centers C and C₂ is CC₂ = r + r₂, and the distance between centers C and C₁ is CC₁ = r₁ - r. Adding these two distances, we get CC₁ + CC₂ = (r₁ - r) + (r + r₂) = r₁ + r₂. Since r₁ and r₂ are the radii of the given circles, their sum is a constant. The locus of a point C that moves such that the sum of its distances from two fixed points (C₁ and C₂) is constant is an ellipse, with C₁ and C₂ as its foci.",

      "Answers": "Given that in triangle ABC, side 'a' (length of BC) is constant. We are also given that tan(B/2)tan(C/2) = λ (constant). Using the half-angle formulas for a triangle, tan(B/2) = √[((s-a)(s-c))/(s(s-b))] and tan(C/2) = √[((s-a)(s-b))/(s(s-c))]. Multiplying these gives tan(B/2)tan(C/2) = (s-a)/s = λ. This simplifies to s-a = λs, which means s(1-λ) = a. Since s = (a+b+c)/2, we have ((a+b+c)/2)(1-λ) = a, leading to a+b+c = 2a/(1-λ). Therefore, b+c = 2a/(1-λ) - a = a(1+λ)/(1-λ). Since 'a' and 'λ' are constants, b+c is also a constant. The sum of the distances of vertex A from the fixed points B and C (which are the lengths b and c) is constant. This is the definition of an ellipse with foci at B and C. Thus, the locus of vertex A is an ellipse.",

      "Answers": "The given equation can be rewritten as 25[(x - 1/5)² + (y - 2/5)²] = (λ - 1)²(3x + 4y - 1)². Dividing by 25, we get (x - 1/5)² + (y - 2/5)² = [(λ - 1)²/25](3x + 4y - 1)².

So, e = |λ-1|/5. For an ellipse, the eccentricity must satisfy 0 < e < 1. This means 0 < |λ-1| < 1. The condition |λ-1| > 0 implies λ ≠ 1. The condition |λ-1| < 1 implies -1 < λ-1 < 1, which means 0 < λ < 2. Combining these, the values of λ are λ ∈ (0, 2) – {1}."

      "Answers": "The equation of the ellipse is given by PS = e·PM.  √(x + 1)² + (y - 1)² = (1/2) |x - y + 3|/√2.

The length of the minor axis is 2a, so 2a = 1, which gives a = 1/2. We use the relation a² = b²(1 - e²) for a vertical ellipse. This gives a² = b² - (be)². Substituting the known values, (1/2)² = b² - 1², so 1/4 = b² - 1, which gives b² = 5/4. The equation of the ellipse is x²/(1/4) + y²/(5/4) = 1, or 4x² + 4y²/5 = 1.

      "Answers": "The greatest distance from the focus (center of Earth) is the apogee, which is a + ae. This is 6378 km (radius) + 947 km (highest point) = 7325 km.

Dividing these two gives (a+ae)/(a-ae) = (1+e)/(1-e) = 7325/6606. Using componendo and dividendo, ( (1+e) - (1-e) ) / ( (1+e) + (1-e) ) = (7325-6606)/(7325+6606). This gives 2e/2 = 719/13931.

Squaring both equations and adding them: (la cos θ + mb sin θ)² + (-la sin θ + mb cos θ)² = (-n)² + (-n)². Expanding the left side gives l²a²(cos²θ+sin²θ) + m²b²(sin²θ+cos²θ) = 2n².

The height is the distance from A to the line segment PQ, which is a - a cos θ. The area of the triangle is Δ = (1/2) × base × height = (1/2) × (2b sin θ) × (a - a cos θ) = ab(sin θ - sin θ cos θ). To find the maximum area, we differentiate with respect to θ and set it to zero: dΔ/dθ = ab(cos θ - cos(2θ)) = 0. This gives cos θ = cos(2θ) = 2cos²θ - 1. So, 2cos²θ - cosθ - 1 = 0, which factors as (2cosθ+1)(cosθ-1)=0. Since θ≠0, cosθ = -1/2, which gives θ = 2π/3. Then sinθ = √3/2.

The chord of contact from this point (t, t-5) to the ellipse is given by T=0: xt/4 + y(t-5) = 1. Rearranging this equation gives xt/4 + yt - 5y - 1 = 0, or t(x/4 + y) - (5y + 1) = 0. This equation is in the form L₁ + λL₂ = 0, which represents a family of lines passing through the intersection of the lines L₁=0 and L₂=0. Here, L₁ is x/4 + y = 0 and L₂ is 5y + 1 = 0. From L₂, we get y = -1/5. Substituting this into L₁ gives x/4 - 1/5 = 0, so x = 4/5. Thus, all chords of contact pass through the fixed point (4/5, -1/5)."

The equation of the chord with midpoint (h, k) is T = S₁, which is hx + 4ky = h² + 4k². Comparing the two equations for the same chord (3x+8y=9 and hx+4ky=h²+4k²), we get h/3 = (4k)/8 = (h²+4k²)/9.

A property of the ellipse states that the image of one focus in any tangent line lies on the line connecting the other focus to the point of contact. Let's find the image S₂' of S₂(2,-1) in the tangent x+y-5=0. The formula for the image (h,k) is (h-x₁)/a = (k-y₁)/b = -2(ax₁+by₁+c)/(a²+b²). So (h-2)/1 = (k-(-1))/1 = -2(2-1-5)/(1²+1²) = 4.

The slopes m₁ and m₂ are the roots of the quadratic equation in m derived from the tangency condition: (h²-a²)m² - 2hkm + (k²-b²) = 0. The product of the roots is m₁m₂ = (k²-b²)/(h²-a²). Setting this equal to 1 gives k²-b² = h²-a², which rearranges to h²-k² = a²-b². Therefore, the locus of P is the hyperbola x²-y² = a²-b²."

      "Answers": "Let the tangent to the first ellipse, x²/4 + y²/1 = 1, be (x/2)cosθ + ysinθ = 1. This line acts as a chord of contact for the second ellipse, x²/6 + y²/3 = 1, with respect to some external point R(h,k). The equation of the chord of contact from R is hx/6 + ky/3 = 1. Comparing the two equations for this line, we find that the locus of the point R is h=3cosθ and k=3sinθ, which means h²+k²=9. The director circle of the second ellipse (x²/6 + y²/3 = 1) is given by the equation x²+y² = a²+b² = 6+3=9. Since the point of intersection R(h,k) lies on the director circle of the second ellipse, the tangents drawn from R to this ellipse (which are the tangents at P and Q) must be at right angles.",

      "Questions": "Let ABC be an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle x² + y² = a². Suppose perpendiculars from A, B, and C to the major axis of the ellipse x²/a² + y²/b² = 1, (a>b), meet the ellipse, respectively, at P, Q, and R so that P, Q, and R lie on the same side of the major axis as A, B, and C, respectively. Prove that the normals to the ellipse drawn at the points P, Q, and R are concurrent.",
      "Answers": "Let the vertices of the equilateral triangle be A(a cosθ, a sinθ), B(a cos(θ+2π/3), a sin(θ+2π/3)), and C(a cos(θ+4π/3), a sin(θ+4π/3)). The corresponding points on the ellipse are P(a cosθ, b sinθ), Q(a cos(θ+2π/3), b sin(θ+2π/3)), and R(a cos(θ+4π/3), b sin(θ+4π/3)). The normals at these points are given by the equations: ax sec(φ) - by cosec(φ) = a²-b², where φ takes the values θ, θ+2π/3, and θ+4π/3. For these three lines to be concurrent, the determinant of their coefficients must be zero. The determinant is Δ = |secθ, -cosecθ, a²-b²|; |sec(θ+2π/3), -cosec(θ+2π/3), a²-b²|; |sec(θ+4π/3), -cosec(θ+4π/3), a²-b²|. This simplifies to checking if the determinant |sinθ, cosθ, sin2θ|; |sin(θ+2π/3), cos(θ+2π/3), sin(2(θ+2π/3))|; |sin(θ+4π/3), cos(θ+4π/3), sin(2(θ+4π/3))| is zero. Since Σsin(φ+2kπ/3)=0 and Σcos(φ+2kπ/3)=0 for k=0,1,2, the sum of the rows is the zero vector, which means the rows are linearly dependent. Therefore, the determinant is zero, and the normals are concurrent.",
