    "question": "Which of the following could Gordon's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n\nHint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.",

    "answer": "D",
    "solution": "Step 1: Think about each change.\nCompost forms from the remains of plants and animals, such as vegetable scraps and egg shells. Compost rotting is a chemical change. As the compost rots, it breaks down and turns into a different type of matter.\nA piece of apple turning brown is a chemical change. The apple reacts with oxygen in the air and turns into a different type of matter.\nIf you scrape off the brown layer of the apple, the inside is still white. The inside hasn't touched the air. So the chemical change didn't happen to that part of the apple.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. They are not physical changes.\nBoth are chemical changes.\nBoth changes are chemical changes. The type of matter before and after each change is different.\nBoth are caused by heating.\nNeither change is caused by heating.\nBoth are caused by cooling.\nNeither change is caused by cooling.",

Choose the most likely ratio.\nA. 0:4\nB. 4:0\nC. 2:2\nD. 1:3\nE. 3:1\n\nHint: This passage describes the fleece type trait in sheep:\nThe fleece, or outer coat, of a sheep is often cut off and used to make yarn for fabrics and other textiles. Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece. In this group, the gene for the fleece type trait has two alleles. The allele for a hairy fleece (F) is dominant over the allele for a woolly fleece (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two sheep.",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a woolly fleece or a hairy fleece, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for a hairy fleece, is dominant over the f allele, which is for a woolly fleece.\nA woolly fleece is the recessive allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the recessive version of the fleece type trait must have only recessive alleles for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a woolly fleece must have the genotype ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype ff.\nA hairy fleece is the dominant allele's version of the fleece type trait. A sheep with the dominant version of the fleece type trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fleece type gene. So, offspring with a hairy fleece must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a woolly fleece to offspring with a hairy fleece is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a woolly fleece. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a hairy fleece.",

He read that using a heating pad to heat up potting soil could help make seeds germinate, or sprout, faster. Kenneth wondered whether the temperature of the heating pad would affect how quickly the seeds germinated.\nKenneth prepared two potting trays, each made up of ten small pots of soil. He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75°F and placed it under one potting tray. He set a second heating pad to 85°F and placed it under the other potting tray. Kenneth observed the pots daily, and he counted the number of days it took until a seed germinated in each pot.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.

Choose the most likely ratio.\nA. 3:1\nB. 2:2\nC. 1:3\nD. 4:0\nE. 0:4\n\nHint: In a group of tomato plants, some individuals have smooth fruit and others have fuzzy fruit. In this group, the gene for the fruit texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth fruit (F) is dominant over the allele for fuzzy fruit (f).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two tomato plants.",
    "answer": "D",
    "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with smooth fruit or fuzzy fruit, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. The question tells you that the F allele, which is for smooth fruit, is dominant over the f allele, which is for fuzzy fruit.\nSmooth fruit is the dominant allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the dominant version of the fruit texture trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with smooth fruit must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype FF or Ff.\nFuzzy fruit is the recessive allele's version of the fruit texture trait. A tomato plant with the recessive version of the fruit texture trait must have only recessive alleles for the fruit texture gene. So, offspring with fuzzy fruit must have the genotype ff.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype ff.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with smooth fruit to offspring with fuzzy fruit is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with smooth fruit. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with fuzzy fruit.",

    "answer": "C",

This change of state, from solid to gas, is called sublimation.\nDry ice becoming a gas is a physical change. A change of state does not form a different type of matter.\nBurning a marshmallow is a chemical change. The heat from the fire causes the type of matter in the marshmallow to change. The marshmallow becomes black and crispy.\nStep 2: Look at each answer choice.\nBoth are only physical changes.\nDry ice sublimating is a physical change.

When a limb is too severely damaged to heal, it may need to be amputated, or removed.\nFor example, a doctor can treat an infected limb with medicine. But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.\nIn other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged.

When a rat eats an insect that has a tapeworm inside it, the insect is digested, but the tapeworm remains alive.\nThe tapeworm is moved into the rat's intestines and uses suckers to attach itself to the intestine wall.

In this group, the gene for the coat color trait has two alleles. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l).\nBlossom is a horse from this group. Blossom has the homozygous genotype ll for the coat color gene.",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "Blossom's genotype for the coat color gene is ll. Blossom's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for a reddish-brown coat. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Blossom's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a black coat (L) is dominant over the allele for a reddish-brown coat (l). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nBlossom's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Blossom's phenotype for the coat color trait must be a reddish-brown coat.",

Choose the most likely ratio.\nA. 1:3\nB. 4:0\nC. 0:4\nD. 2:2\nE. 3:1\n\nHint: In a group of rats, some individuals have a normal-sized body and others have a dwarf body. In this group, the gene for the body size trait has two alleles. The allele for a dwarf body (b) is recessive to the allele for a normal-sized body (B).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two rats.",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with a normal-sized body or a dwarf body, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the body size trait. The question tells you that the b allele, which is for a dwarf body, is recessive to the B allele, which is for a normal-sized body.\nA normal-sized body is the dominant allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the dominant version of the body size trait must have at least one dominant allele for the body size gene. So, offspring with a normal-sized body must have the genotype BB or Bb.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype BB or Bb.\nA dwarf body is the recessive allele's version of the body size trait. A rat with the recessive version of the body size trait must have only recessive alleles for the body size gene. So, offspring with a dwarf body must have the genotype bb.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype bb.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with a normal-sized body to offspring with a dwarf body is 4:0. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will always produce offspring with a normal-sized body. This cross is expected to never produce offspring with a dwarf body.",

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nLacey poured four ounces of water into each of six glasses. Lacey dissolved one tablespoon of salt in each of three glasses, and did not add salt to the other three. Then, Lacey placed an egg in one glass and observed if the egg floated. She removed the egg and dried it. She repeated the process with the other five glasses, recording each time if the egg floated. Lacey repeated this test with two more eggs and counted the number of times the eggs floated in fresh water compared to salty water.\nFigure: an egg floating in a glass of salty water.",

In this group, the gene for the coat graying trait has two alleles. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g).\nDolly is a horse from this group. Dolly has the homozygous genotype gg for the coat graying gene.",
    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "Dolly's genotype for the coat graying gene is gg. Dolly's genotype of gg has only g alleles. The g allele is for not having a graying coat. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Dolly's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for having a graying coat (G) is dominant over the allele for not having a graying coat (g). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.\nDolly's genotype of gg has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Dolly's phenotype for the coat graying trait must be not having a graying coat.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel.

Jellyfish and sea anemone, for example, are both part of the phylum Cnidaria. Cnidaria comes from a Greek word that means \"nettle,\" a stinging type of plant. Cnidarians are known for the tentacles that surround their mouths, which they use to sting and capture prey. All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins. Unlike a cnidarian's wavy tentacles, these spines are used for protection, not to capture prey.",

In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for brown fur (f) is recessive to the allele for black fur (F).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two rabbits.",
    "answer": "D",
    "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with black fur or brown fur, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. The question tells you that the f allele, which is for brown fur, is recessive to the F allele, which is for black fur.\nBlack fur is the dominant allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the dominant version of the fur color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the fur color gene. So, offspring with black fur must have the genotype FF or Ff.\nThere are 3 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype FF or Ff. These boxes are highlighted below.\nBrown fur is the recessive allele's version of the fur color trait. A rabbit with the recessive version of the fur color trait must have only recessive alleles for the fur color gene. So, offspring with brown fur must have the genotype ff.\nThere is 1 box in the Punnett square with the genotype ff. This box is highlighted below.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with black fur to offspring with brown fur is 3:1. This means that, on average, this cross will produce 3 offspring with black fur for every 1 offspring with brown fur.",

Analogous structures are parts with the same purpose but with different structures, like a fin and a flipper. Different species may develop analogous structures when they live in similar environments even if they aren't closely related.\nHomologous structures, however, may show that species are related by indicating they have common ancestors. A whale is a mammal, which makes it more closely related to a bear than to a fish, and a whale's flipper has bones like those in a bear's paw. Though they are different shapes and sizes, the arrangement of bones is similar.",

The western half is part of Indonesia, an Asian country.\nBeginning in the 17 th century, several countries took control of different parts of the island of New Guinea. By 1922, Australia controlled the entire eastern half of the island, and the Netherlands controlled the western half. In 1963, control over the western half was transferred to Indonesia, which had just gained independence from the Netherlands. Many people in western New Guinea did not want to become part of Indonesia, though, and some people in this area are still fighting to leave Indonesia today. The eastern part gained independence from Australia in 1975 and became Papua New Guinea.",

In this group, the gene for the growth pattern trait has two alleles. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G).\nA certain rose plant from this group has the homozygous genotype GG for the growth pattern gene.",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "The rose plant's genotype for the growth pattern gene is GG. The rose plant's genotype of GG has only G allelles. The G allele is for climbing growth. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the rose plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for bush growth (g) is recessive to the allele for climbing growth (G). This means G is a dominant allele, and g is a recessive allele.\nThe rose plant's genotype of GG has two dominant alleles. An organism with at least one dominant allele for a gene will have the dominant allele's version of the trait. So, the rose plant's phenotype for the growth pattern trait must be climbing growth.",

In this group, the gene for the pod color trait has two alleles. The allele for yellow pods (d) is recessive to the allele for green pods (D).\nThis Punnett square shows a cross between two pea plants.",
    "answer": "C",
    "solution": "To determine how many boxes in the Punnett square represent offspring with yellow pods or green pods, consider whether each phenotype is the dominant or recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. The question tells you that the d allele, which is for yellow pods, is recessive to the D allele, which is for green pods.\nYellow pods is the recessive allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the recessive version of the pod color trait must have only recessive alleles for the pod color gene. So, offspring with yellow pods must have the genotype dd.\nThere are 0 boxes in the Punnett square with the genotype dd.\nGreen pods is the dominant allele's version of the pod color trait. A pea plant with the dominant version of the pod color trait must have at least one dominant allele for the pod color gene. So, offspring with green pods must have the genotype DD or Dd.\nAll 4 boxes in the Punnett square have the genotype DD or Dd.\nSo, the expected ratio of offspring with yellow pods to offspring with green pods is 0:4. This means that, based on the Punnett square, this cross will never produce offspring with yellow pods. Instead, this cross is expected to always produce offspring with green pods.",

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nMuscle movement is controlled by charged atoms called ions. Ions move in and out of muscle cells through tube-like structures called channels.\nOne of these channels is made from the chloride channel protein. The chloride channel protein is encoded by the CLCN1 gene.\nA certain person had a mutation in the CLCN1 gene. Compared to the CLCN1 gene without a mutation, the mutated CLCN1 gene encoded a form of the chloride channel protein with a different structure.\nThis different form of the chloride channel protein allowed fewer ions than normal to travel through it.

In this group, the gene for the stem height trait has two alleles. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h).\nA certain pea plant from this group has the homozygous genotype hh for the stem height gene.",
    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "The pea plant's genotype for the stem height gene is hh. The pea plant's genotype of hh has only h alleles. The h allele is for a short stem. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the pea plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for a tall stem (H) is dominant over the allele for a short stem (h). This means H is a dominant allele, and h is a recessive allele.\nThe pea plant's genotype of hh has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the pea plant's phenotype for the stem height trait must be a short stem.",

In this group, the gene for the fur color trait has two alleles. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F).\nCleo is a rock pocket mouse from this group. Cleo has the homozygous genotype ff for the fur color gene.",
    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "Cleo's genotype for the fur color gene is ff. Cleo's genotype of ff has only f alleles. The f allele is for light fur. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.\nTo check this answer, consider whether Cleo's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for light fur (f) is recessive to the allele for dark fur (F). This means F is a dominant allele, and f is a recessive allele.\nCleo's genotype of ff has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, Cleo's phenotype for the fur color trait must be light fur.",

In this group, the gene for the leaf texture trait has two alleles. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L).\nA certain summer squash plant from this group has the homozygous genotype ll for the leaf texture gene.",
    "answer": "B",
    "solution": "The summer squash plant's genotype for the leaf texture gene is ll. The summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only l alleles. The l allele is for smooth leaves. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.\nTo check this answer, consider whether the summer squash plant's alleles are dominant or recessive. The allele for smooth leaves (l) is recessive to the allele for fuzzy leaves (L). This means L is a dominant allele, and l is a recessive allele.\nThe summer squash plant's genotype of ll has only recessive alleles. An organism with only recessive alleles for a gene will have the recessive allele's version of the trait. So, the summer squash plant's phenotype for the leaf texture trait must be smooth leaves.",

    "question": "Which term matches the picture?\nA. operant conditioning\nB. classical conditioning\n\nHint: Read the text.\nA conditioned response occurs when an animal learns to associate two events that were not originally related. For example, a dog will naturally salivate at the smell of food (an unconditioned response). However, if a dog learns that the sound of a ringing bell is a sure sign that dinner is coming, it will begin to react to the sound of that bell the same way it reacts to the smell of food (a conditioned response). This is called classical conditioning.\nOperant conditioning is a process like classical conditioning. However, in classical conditioning, the events that an animal learns to associate are not under the animal's voluntary control. In operant conditioning, an external event that is either a reward or punishment becomes linked with a voluntary behavior. For example, a student who receives a gold star for sitting quietly is more likely to choose to sit quietly in the future. The behavior (sitting quietly) has become linked in the student's mind with the reward that it produced in the past. Animal trainers rely on operant conditioning to encourage desired behaviors and discourage unwanted ones.",
    "answer": "A",
    "solution": "A dog receiving a treat for sitting and staying is an example of operant conditioning. The treat is a reward that encourages wanted behavior, like sitting, in the future.",

    "solution": "Each particle in the two samples has the same mass, and the particles in both samples have the same average speed.
