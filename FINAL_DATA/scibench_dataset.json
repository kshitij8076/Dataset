    "answer": " 0.54",
    "solution": "\nWe continue to use our simple model of the ocean surrounding Earth. Newton proposed a solution to this calculation by imagining that two wells be dug, one along the direction of high tide (our $x$-axis) and one along the direction of low tide (our $y$-axis). If the tidal height change we want to determine is $h$, then the difference in potential energy of mass $m$ due to the height difference is $m g h$. Let's calculate the difference in work if we move the mass $m$ from point $c$ to the center of Earth and then to point $a$. This work $W$ done by gravity must equal the potential energy change $m g h$. The work $W$ is\r\n$$\r\nW=\\int_{r+\\delta_1}^0 F_{T_y} d y+\\int_0^{r+\\delta_2} F_{T_x} d x\r\n$$. The small distances $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are to account for the small variations from a spherical Earth, but these values are so small they can be henceforth neglected. The value for $W$ becomes\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nW & =\\frac{G m M_m}{D^3}\\left[\\int_r^0(-y) d y+\\int_0^r 2 x d x\\right] \\\\\r\n& =\\frac{G m M_m}{D^3}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{2}+r^2\\right)=\\frac{3 G m M_m r^2}{2 D^3}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$\r\nBecause this work is equal to $m g h$, we have\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nm g h & =\\frac{3 G m M_m r^2}{2 D^3} \\\\\r\nh & =\\frac{3 G M_m r^2}{2 g D^3}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$\r\nNote that the mass $m$ cancels, and the value of $h$ does not depend on $m$.

    "solution": "\nWe assume that salt is neither created nor destroyed in the tank. Therefore variations in the amount of salt are due solely to the flows in and out of the tank. More precisely, the rate of change of salt in the tank, $d Q / d t$, is equal to the rate at which salt is flowing in minus the rate at which it is flowing out. In symbols,\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{d Q}{d t}=\\text { rate in }- \\text { rate out }\r\n$$\r\nThe rate at which salt enters the tank is the concentration $\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{gal}$ times the flow rate $r \\mathrm{gal} / \\mathrm{min}$, or $(r / 4) \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{min}$. To find the rate at which salt leaves the tankl we need to multiply the concentration of salt in the tank by the rate of outflow, $r \\mathrm{gal} / \\mathrm{min}$. Since the rates of flow in and out are equal, the volume of water in the tank remains constant at $100 \\mathrm{gal}$, and since the mixture is \"well-stirred,\" the concentration throughout the tank is the same, namely, $[Q(t) / 100] \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{gal}$. Therefore the rate at which salt leaves the tank is $[r Q(t) / 100] \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{min}$. Thus the differential equation governing this process is\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{d Q}{d t}=\\frac{r}{4}-\\frac{r Q}{100}\r\n$$\r\nThe initial condition is\r\n$$\r\nQ(0)=Q_0\r\n$$\r\nUpon thinking about the problem physically, we might anticipate that eventually the mixture originally in the tank will be essentially replaced by the mixture flowing in, whose concentration is $\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{gal}$. Consequently, we might expect that ultimately the amount of salt in the tank would be very close to $25 \\mathrm{lb}$. We can also find the limiting amount $Q_L=25$ by setting $d Q / d t$ equal to zero in the equation and solving the resulting algebraic equation for $Q$. Rewriting the above equation in the standard form for a linear equation, we have\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{d Q}{d t}+\\frac{r Q}{100}=\\frac{r}{4}\r\n$$\r\nThus the integrating factor is $e^{r t / 100}$ and the general solution is\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25+c e^{-r t / 100}\r\n$$\r\nwhere $c$ is an arbitrary constant. To satisfy the initial condition, we must choose $c=Q_0-25$. Therefore the solution of the initial value problem is\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25+\\left(Q_0-25\\right) e^{-r t / 100}\r\n$$\r\nor\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25\\left(1-e^{-r t / 100}\\right)+Q_0 e^{-r t / 100}\r\n$$\r\nFrom Eq., you can see that $Q(t) \\rightarrow 25$ (lb) as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, so the limiting value $Q_L$ is 25 , confirming our physical intuition. Further, $Q(t)$ approaches the limit more rapidly as $r$ increases. In interpreting the solution, note that the second term on the right side is the portion of the original salt that remains at time $t$, while the first term gives the amount of salt in the tank due to the action of the flow processes. Now suppose that $r=3$ and $Q_0=2 Q_L=50$; then Eq. becomes\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25+25 e^{-0.03 t}\r\n$$\r\nSince $2 \\%$ of 25 is 0.5 , we wish to find the time $T$ at which $Q(t)$ has the value 25.5. Substituting $t=T$ and $Q=25.5$ in Eq. (8) and solving for $T$, we obtain\r\n$$\r\nT=(\\ln 50) / 0.03 \\cong 130.400766848(\\mathrm{~min}) .\r\n$$\n",

    "answer": "-4.37 ",
    "solution": "\nWe can approximate Earth as a uniform sphere of mass $M_E$. Then the gravitational acceleration at any distance $r$ from the center of Earth is\n$$\na_g=\\frac{G M_E}{r^2}\n$$\nWe might simply apply this equation twice, first with $r=$ $6.77 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}$ for the location of the feet and then with $r=6.77 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}+1.70 \\mathrm{~m}$ for the location of the head. However, a calculator may give us the same value for $a_g$ twice, and thus a difference of zero, because $h$ is so much smaller than $r$.

The directions are indicated, and the magnitudes are $F_1=6.0 \\mathrm{~N}, F_2=12 \\mathrm{~N}$, and $F_3=14 \\mathrm{~N}$. What is the acceleration of the center of mass of the system?",
    "answer": " 1.16",

Neglecting the effects of Earth's atmosphere on the asteroid, find the asteroid's speed $v_f$ when it reaches Earth's surface.",
    "answer": "1.60",
    "solution": "\nBecause we are to neglect the effects of the atmosphere on the asteroid, the mechanical energy of the asteroid-Earth system is conserved during the fall. Thus, the final mechanical energy (when the asteroid reaches Earth's surface) is equal to the initial mechanical energy. With kinetic energy $K$ and gravitational potential energy $U$, we can write this as\n$$\nK_f+U_f=K_i+U_i\n$$\nAlso, if we assume the system is isolated, the system's linear momentum must be conserved during the fall. Therefore, the momentum change of the asteroid and that of Earth must be equal in magnitude and opposite in sign. However, because Earth's mass is so much greater than the asteroid's mass, the change in Earth's speed is negligible relative to the change in the asteroid's speed. So, the change in Earth's kinetic energy is also negligible. Thus, we can assume that the kinetic energies in above equation are those of the asteroid alone.\n\nCalculations: Let $m$ represent the asteroid's mass and $M$ represent Earth's mass $\\left(5.98 \\times 10^{24} \\mathrm{~kg}\\right)$.
