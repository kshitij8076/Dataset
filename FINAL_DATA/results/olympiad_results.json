Three of these points are selected at random and a triangle is formed using these points as its vertices.\n\nThrough this solution, we will use the following facts:\n\nWhen an acute triangle is inscribed in a circle:\n\n- each of the three angles of the triangle is the angle inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended,\n- each of the three arcs into which the circle is divided by the vertices of the triangles is less than half of the circumference of the circle, and\n- it contains the centre of the circle.\n\nWhy are these facts true?\n\n- Consider a chord of a circle which is not a diameter.\n\nThen the angle subtended in the major arc of this circle is an acute angle and the angle subtended in the minor arc is an obtuse angle.\n\nNow consider an acute triangle inscribed in a circle.\n\nSince each angle of the triangle is acute, then each of the three angles is inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended.\n\n- It follows that each arc of the circle that is outside the triangle must be a minor arc, thus less than the circumference of the circle.\n- Lastly, if the centre was outside the triangle, then we would be able to draw a diameter of the circle with the triangle entirely on one side of the diameter.\n\n<image_1>\n\nIn this case, one of the arcs of the circle cut off by one of the sides of the triangle would have to be a major arc, which cannot happen, because of the above.\n\nTherefore, the centre is contained inside the triangle.\nIf $N=7$, what is the probability that the triangle is acute?

The ride takes place entirely in a two dimensional plane.\n\nSome students made a remark that at one time, the acceleration was perpendicular to the velocity. Using this graph, what is the minimum x-velocity the ride could be travelling at for this to be true? Round to the nearest integer and answer in meters per second.

Upon hitting the reflective planet, the light from the laser is plane polarized. The angle of the planet's polarizer is always the same as the angle of reflection. After reflectance, the laser lands a direct hit on the insulator planet. Darth Vader locks the laser in on the planet until it moves right in front of him, when he turns the laser off.

Bob starts at point $A$, and moves an angle $\\theta$ counterclockwise to point $B$ (such that $A O B$ is an isosceles triangle). At time $t=0$, the mass at point $O$ is released. Given that the mass comes close enough for Bob to catch it, find the value of $\\theta$ to the nearest tenth of a degree.\n\nAssume that the only force acting on the mass is the spring's tension, and that the astronauts' heights are much less than $R$.\n\n<image_1>",

Its setup consists of a steel ball, represented by a point mass, of negligible radius and a frictionless vertical track. The goal of Pico-Pico is to flick the ball from the beginning of the track (point $A$ ) such that it is able to traverse through the track while never leaving the track, successfully reaching the end (point $B)$. The most famous track design is one of parabolic shape; specifically, the giant track is of the shape $h(x)=5-2 x^{2}$ in meters. The starting and ending points of the tracks are where the two points where the track intersects $y=0$. If $\\left(v_{a}, v_{b}\\right]$ is the range of the ball's initial velocity $v_{0}$ that satisfies the winning condition of Pico-Pico, help Poncho find $v_{b}-v_{a}$.

It is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}=\\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the surrounding fluid, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is a reference length parameter that varies based on each object.

Due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, empirical data is commonly used, as depicted in the figure provided above. Notably, the figure indicates a significant decrease in the drag coefficient around $\\operatorname{Re} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{5}$. This phenomenon, known as the drag crisis, occurs when a sphere transitions from laminar to turbulent flow, resulting in a broad wake and high drag.\n\nLet's consider a smooth ball with a radius of $0.2 \\mathrm{~m}$ and a mass of $0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ dropped in air with a constant density of $\\rho=1.255 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.

If the ball is thrown downwards with enough velocity, it will experience turbulence, and approach a stable terminal velocity $v_{2}$. Find $\\Delta v=v_{2}-v_{1}$. Ignore any terminal velocities found for Reynold numbers less than an order of magnitude $10^{-1}$.\n\nNote: This problem is highly idealized as it assumes the atmosphere has air of constant density and temperature.

In this mechanism, an active particle continuously climbs up the field-gradient generated by its own influence on the environment so that the particle can bootstrap itself into a constant non-zero velocity motion. Consider a field-drive in one-dimensional (the $\\mathrm{O} x$ axis) environment, where the position of the particle at time $t$ is given by $X(t)$ and its instantaneous velocity follows from:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} X(t)=\\left.\\kappa \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} R(x, t)\\right|_{x=X(t)}\n$$\nin which $\\kappa$ is called the guiding coefficient and $R(x, t)$ is the field-value in this space. Note that, the operation ... $\\left.\\right|_{x=X(t)}$ means you have to calculate the part in ... first, then replace $x$ with $X(t)$. For a biological example, the active particle can be a cell, the field can be the nutrient concentration, and the strategy of climbing up the gradient can be chemotaxis. The cell consumes the nutrient and also responses to the local nutrient concentration, biasing its movement toward the direction where the concentration increases the most. If the nutrient is not diffusive and always recovers locally (e.g. a surface secretion) to the value which we defined to be 0 , then its dynamics can usually be approximated by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} R(x, t)=-\\frac{1}{\\tau} R(x, t)-\\gamma \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{[x-X(t)]^{2}}{2 \\lambda^{2}}\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the timescale of recovery, $\\gamma$ is the consumption, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic radius of influence. Before we inoculate the cell into the environment, $R=0$ everywhere at any time. What is the smallest guiding coefficient $\\kappa$ (in $\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ ) for field-drive to emerge, if the parameters are $\\tau=50 \\mathrm{~s}, \\gamma=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, and $\\lambda=10 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.\n\n\n\n<image_1>",

      "question": "The rotating neutron star. \n\nA 'millisecond pulsar' is a source of radiation in the universe that emits very short pulses with a period of one to several milliseconds. This radiation is in the radio range of wavelengths; and a suitable radio receiver can be used to detect the separate pulses and thereby to measure the period with great accuracy.\n\nThese radio pulses originate from the surface of a particular sort of star, the so-called neutron star. These stars are very compact: they have a mass of the same order of magnitude as that of the sun, but their radius is only a few tens of kilometers. They spin very quickly. Because of the fast rotation, a neutron star is slightly flattened (oblate). Assume the axial cross-section of the surface to be an ellipse with almost equal axes. Let $r_{p}$ be the polar and $r_{e}$ the equatorial radii; and let us define the flattening factor by:\n\n$$\n\\epsilon=\\frac{\\left(r_{e}-r_{p}\\right)}{r_{p}}\n$$\n\n\n\n| a mass of | $2.0 \\cdot 10^{30} \\mathrm{~kg}$, |\n| :--- | :--- |\n| an average radius of | $1.0 \\cdot 10^{4} \\mathrm{~m}$, |\n| and a rotation period of | $2.0 \\cdot 10^{-2} \\mathrm{~s}$. |\nContext question:\na - Calculate the flattening factor, given that the gravitational constant is $6.67 \\times 10^{-11}$ N.m $\\cdot \\mathrm{kg}^{-2}$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$3.7 \\times 10^{-4}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nIn the long run (over many years) the rotation of the star slows down, due to energy loss, and this leads to a decrease in the flattening. The star has however a solid crust that floats on a liquid interior. The solid crust resists a continuous adjustment to equilibrium shape. Instead, starquakes occur with sudden changes in the shape of the crust towards equilibrium. During and after such a star-quake the angular velocity is observed to change according to figure 1.\n\n<img_4573>\n\nA sudden change in the shape of the crust of a neutron star results in a sudden change of the angular velocity.\n\n$\\mathrm{b}$ - Calculate the average radius of the liquid interior, using the data of Fig. 1. Make the approximation that the densities of the crust and the interior are the same. (Ignore the change in shape of the interior).",

Bosons do not respect the Pauli exclusion principle, and-at low temperatures or high densitiesexperience a dramatic phenomenon known as the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). This is a phase transition to an intriguing collective quantum state: a large number of identical particles 'condense' into a single quantum state and start behaving as a single wave. The transition is typically reached by cooling a fixed number of particles below the critical temperature. In principle, it can also be induced by keeping the temperature fixed and driving the particle density past its critical value.\n\nWe begin by exploring the relation between the temperature and the particle density at the transition.

      "question": "Particles and Waves\n\nWave-particle duality, which states that each particle can be described as a wave and vice versa, is one of the central concepts of quantum mechanics. In this problem, we will rely on this notion and just a few other basic assumptions to explore a selection of quantum phenomena covering the two distinct types of particles of the microworld-fermions and bosons.\n\n Part A. Quantum particle in a box\n\nConsider a particle of mass $m$ moving in a one-dimensional potential well, where its potential energy $V(x)$ is given by\n\n$$\nV(x)= \\begin{cases}0, & 0 \\leq x \\leq L \\\\ \\infty, & x<0 \\text { or } x>L\\end{cases}\n\\tag{1}\n$$\n\nWhile classical particle can move in such a potential having any kinetic energy, for quantum particle only some specific positive discrete energy levels are allowed. In any such allowed state, the particle can be described as a standing de Broglie wave with nodes at the walls.\nContext question:\nA.1 Determine the minimal possible energy $E_{\\min }$ of the quantum particle in the well. Express your answer in terms of $m, L$, and the Planck's constant $h$.\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$E_{\\min }=\\frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$}\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nThe particle's state with minimal possible energy is called the ground state, and all the rest allowed states are called excited states. Let us sort all the possible energy values in the increasing order and denote them as $E_{n}$, starting from $E_{1}$ for the ground state.\nContext question:\nA.2 Find the general expression for the energy $E_{n}$ (here $n=1,2,3, \\ldots$ ).\nContext answer:\n\\boxed{$E_{n}=\\frac{h^{2} n^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$}\n\n\nContext question:\nA.3 Particle can undergo instantaneous transition from one state to another only by emitting or absorbing a photon of the corresponding energy difference.

Bose-Einstein condensation\n\nThis part is not directly related to Parts A and B. Here, we will study the collective behaviour of bosonic particles. Bosons do not respect the Pauli exclusion principle, and-at low temperatures or high densitiesexperience a dramatic phenomenon known as the Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC). This is a phase transition to an intriguing collective quantum state: a large number of identical particles 'condense' into a single quantum state and start behaving as a single wave. The transition is typically reached by cooling a fixed number of particles below the critical temperature. In principle, it can also be induced by keeping the temperature fixed and driving the particle density past its critical value.\n\nWe begin by exploring the relation between the temperature and the particle density at the transition.

Provide a simple argument to prove that this is indeed the case.\nContext answer:\n证明题\n\n\nExtra Supplementary Reading Materials:\n\nThe above observation of symmetry simplifies the analysis of the two-dimensional potential distribution $V(\\vec{r})$. As shown in Fig. 2b, a regular hexagon has symmetry lines that, respectively, connect opposite vertices (solid lines) and midpoints of opposite edges (dashed lines). Therefore, in our situation one does not need to produce and study two-dimensional potential plots as many insights can be deduced by focusing on the coordinate axes $x$ and $y$ that run along the symmetry lines.\nContext question:\nD.3 Derive the behavior of the potential $V(\\vec{r})$ along the coordinate axes, i.e., determine the functions $V_{X}(x) \\equiv V(x, 0)$ and $V_{Y}(y) \\equiv V(0, y)$.

The obtained minima of single-argument functions $V_{X}$ and $V_{Y}$ identify their suspected positions but still have to be checked to eliminate the saddle points. As shown in Fig. 2c, when studied along a single line, saddle points may disguise as minima but they are not.\n\nD.5 Calculate the value of $n$ that corresponds to the radius of the Rb Rydberg atom comparable to the wavelength of laser light $\\lambda_{\\text {las }}=380 \\mathrm{~nm}$.
