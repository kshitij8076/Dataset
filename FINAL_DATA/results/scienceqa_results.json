      "question": "Which of the following could Gordon's test show?\nA. if the spacecraft was damaged when using a parachute with a 1 m vent going 200 km per hour\nB. how steady a parachute with a 1 m vent was at 200 km per hour\nC. whether a parachute with a 1 m vent would swing too much at 400 km per hour\n\nHint: People can use the engineering-design process to develop solutions to problems. One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nGordon was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Gordon put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.",

Woolly fleeces, which have shorter hairs, are usually used for clothing and blankets. Hairy fleeces, which have longer hairs, are usually used for carpets.\nIn a group of sheep, some individuals have a hairy fleece and others have a woolly fleece.

He planted one cucumber seed in each small pot and arranged the potting trays near a sunny window. He set an electric heating pad to 75Â°F and placed it under one potting tray.

The limb has healed from a serious disease.\n\nHint: If a person's body is damaged, the body can often heal itself. But sometimes, disease or injury can cause damage that is too severe to heal. When a limb is too severely damaged to heal, it may need to be amputated, or removed.\nFor example, a doctor can treat an infected limb with medicine. But if the infection does not go away, it can spread to the rest of the person's body. To stop the infection from spreading, the infected limb may need to be amputated.\nIn other cases, when a limb is badly injured, the skin, bones, muscles, and nerves may be severely damaged. If the damaged tissue cannot heal, it may die. The severely damaged or dead tissue then needs to be amputated.",

The fabric needed to absorb one drop of water in less than one second and dry completely in less than five minutes. Edwin thought a fabric made from cotton and polyester would both absorb water well and dry quickly. But he needed to decide what percentage of each material to use.\nSo, he made a sample fabric that was 50% cotton and 50% polyester. Then he put one drop of water on the sample. He timed how long it took the fabric to dry after the water was absorbed.\nFigure: fabric that has not absorbed drops of water.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCharlotte was designing small aircraft called drones to pick up items from warehouse shelves. She knew that the drones' propeller blades would get damaged if they bumped into anything while flying through the warehouse. So, Charlotte wanted to add blade guards to protect the propeller blades. The guards had to be sturdy so they would not break in a crash. But she thought that if the guards weighed too much, the drones would not fly well.\nSo, Charlotte put guards made of lightweight metal on one drone. Then she observed how well the drone flew with the guards.\nFigure: a drone without blade guards.",

One step in the process is testing if a potential solution meets the requirements of the design.\nThe passage below describes how the engineering-design process was used to test a solution to a problem. Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nRobert was an aerospace engineer who was developing a parachute for a spacecraft that would land on Mars. He needed to add a vent at the center of the parachute so the spacecraft would land smoothly. However, the spacecraft would have to travel at a high speed before landing. If the vent was too big or too small, the parachute might swing wildly at this speed. The movement could damage the spacecraft.\nSo, to help decide how big the vent should be, Robert put a parachute with a 1 m vent in a wind tunnel. The wind tunnel made it seem like the parachute was moving at 200 km per hour. He observed the parachute to see how much it swung.\nFigure: a spacecraft's parachute in a wind tunnel.",

All species that belong in the Cnidaria phyla live exclusively in the ocean.\nAnother phylum of invertebrates found only in oceans is the Echinodermata, a term that comes from Greek words meaning \"spiny\" and \"skin.\" Echinoderms, members of this phylum, have stiff bodies and often have stiff, sharp spines covering their skins.

Do steel nails take fewer days to rust in water compared to vinegar?\n\nHint: The passage below describes an experiment. Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nLogan put one two-inch steel nail into each of six test tubes. He added water to three of the test tubes and vinegar to the other three. In each test tube, he completely covered the nail with the same volume of liquid. Logan checked the nails for rust at the same time every day.

How can the writer best improve his or her academic voice?\nMany people don't recycle because throwing things away is easier, even though doing so can be damaging to the environment. People are lazy and selfish, always wanting what is good for themselves, not necessarily what is good for society. As a result, many people do not take the steps that are required to recycle different materials. For example, some towns require residents to sort items before leaving them at the curbside; this causes some to skip recycling altogether, even though doing so is unethical.\nA. by avoiding first-person pronouns\nB. by including technical terms\nC. by maintaining an objective tone",

Read the passage and then follow the instructions below.\n\nJanelle planted 20 radish plants in a greenhouse, putting each plant in its own pot. She placed ten of the pots under bright light and the other ten pots under dim light. Janelle watered all the plants twice a day. After two months, she pulled the radish plants from the ground, threw away the leafy green tops, and measured the sizes of the radishes. She compared the sizes of the radishes grown under bright light to the sizes of the radishes grown under dim light.\nFigure: a radish plant in soil.",

They grow extra-thick coats of fur to keep warm in winter. The thick fur traps their body heat and keeps it close to their skin. Many wild animals grow winter coats. But so do some cats and dogs.\nSome animals, like arctic foxes, also change coat colors in winter. They shed their brown fur and grow thick white coats.

These grasses crowded out other plants. Dr. Spencer thought that she could use fire to remove the unwanted grasses and allow other plants to grow. But she didn't know how often the prairie should be burned.\nDr. Spencer marked off six plots within a large area of the prairie. She used carefully controlled fires to burn all of the plants in each plot. She burned three of the plots once a year for three years. She burned the other three plots twice a year for three years. A year after the last fire, Dr. Spencer counted the number of unwanted grasses in each of the six plots.\nHint: An independent variable is a variable whose effect you are investigating.
