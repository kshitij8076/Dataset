It is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}=\\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the surrounding fluid, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is a reference length parameter that varies based on each object.

Due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, empirical data is commonly used, as depicted in the figure provided above. Notably, the figure indicates a significant decrease in the drag coefficient around $\\operatorname{Re} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{5}$. This phenomenon, known as the drag crisis, occurs when a sphere transitions from laminar to turbulent flow, resulting in a broad wake and high drag.\n\nLet's consider a smooth ball with a radius of $0.2 \\mathrm{~m}$ and a mass of $0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ dropped in air with a constant density of $\\rho=1.255 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$.

If the ball is dropped from rest, it approaches a stable terminal velocity $v_{1}$. If the ball is thrown downwards with enough velocity, it will experience turbulence, and approach a stable terminal velocity $v_{2}$. Find $\\Delta v=v_{2}-v_{1}$. Ignore any terminal velocities found for Reynold numbers less than an order of magnitude $10^{-1}$.\n\nNote: This problem is highly idealized as it assumes the atmosphere has air of constant density and temperature.

The coefficient of friction between the thread and the cylinder is $\\mu$. The free end of the thread is being pulled parallel to the axis of the cylinder (as shown by arrow in\n\n<image_1>\nthe photo) while keeping the cylinder at rest. If the length of the loop is longer than a critical value, $L>L_{0}$, the loop can slide along the cylinder without changing its shape, otherwise the friction \"locks\" it into a place and increasing the pulling force would eventually just break the thread. Find this critical value $L_{0}$. The weight of the thread is to be neglected; the thread will not twist when being pulled.\n\nIt might be useful to know that\n\n$$\n2 \\int \\sqrt{1+x^{2}} \\mathrm{~d} x=x \\sqrt{1+x^{2}}+\\operatorname{arcsinh} x,\n$$\n\nwhere $\\operatorname{arcsinh} x \\equiv \\ln \\left(x+\\sqrt{1+x^{2}}\\right)$.\n2 \\pi R\n2 R\n2 \\pi R\nL_0 = 2\\pi R + R",

This phenomenon can be modelled by a lens setup, see the photo on right, and the diagram beneath the photos.\n<image_1>\n\nThe photo on right was taken by a digital single-lens reflex camera. The light intensity at the camera sensor pixels marked by a red line (in the photo) is shown in the graph below: the log base 10 of the light intensity (measured as the number of photons caught by each pixel) is plotted against the $x$-coordinate, with the pixels' side length serving as the unit length.\n\n<image_2>\n\nThe lens modelling cat eyes can be treated as an ideal thin lens of focal length $f=55 \\mathrm{~mm}$ and diameter $D=$ $39 \\mathrm{~mm}$; however, you should keep in mind that the given graph shows real measurement data, and the lens has certain non-ideal features. Most importantly, partial reflections of brightly lit areas from the lens surfaces may decrease the contrast: dark areas seen through the lens appear less dark than they actually are; this effect can be neglected for the camera lens, but not so for the lens serving as a model of a cat's eye.\n\nBased on the given data, estimate (with the accuracy of ca 20\\%) the distance $h$ between the axis of the camera and the axis of the lamp (which can be considered as a point source) if the distance of the camera from the paper sheet was $L=4.8 \\mathrm{~m}$.\n4.4 \\, \\text{cm}\n80\n0.0116 \\mathrm{~m}\n20",
