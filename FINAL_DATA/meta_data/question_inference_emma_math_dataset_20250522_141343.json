What is the smallest number of moves he needs to make to arrange all the dominoes correctly?",
      "answer": "3",
      "solution": "The dominoes in the line contain three ends with four spots and three ends with six spots, as shown in diagram 1. Therefore, a correctly arranged set of these dominoes will have four spots at one end and six spots at the other, as is currently the case. Hence, Paul does not need to move either of the end dominoes.  If he swaps the third and the fifth dominoes from diagram 1, he obtains the row shown in diagram 2 which has the same number of spots in the adjacent ends of the fourth, fifth and sixth dominoes. Next, if he swaps the second and third dominoes from diagram 2 to obtain the line shown in diagram 3 , he has matched the spots at the adjacent ends of the first and second dominoes. Finally, rotating the third domino in diagram 3, he obtains the correctly arranged line as shown in diagram 4 . This shows that it is possible to arrange the dominos correctly in three moves.  To see that two moves is not sufficient, note that, whatever else needs to happen, the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ must be correctly placed next to each other. To do that requires one of the dominos with a 1 to be rotated and then one pair of dominos to be swapped so that the two $1 \\mathrm{~s}$ are now next to each other. A similar argument applies to the two dominos with a 3. However, this is not possible in only two moves. Therefore the smallest number of moves he needs to make is 3 .  ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_0f4ed2787981bb911326g-246.jpg?height=362&width=1542&top_left_y=458&top_left_x=400)",

      "answer": "E",
      "solution": "Since the triangle formed when the trapeziums are put together is equilateral, the smaller angles in the isosceles trapeziums are both $60^{\\circ}$.

      "solution": "Since the total area of a square created with $N$ of the pieces shown will be $5 N$, we need $5 N$ to be a square number. Therefore $N$ is of the form $5 m^{2}$ for some integer $m$ and, of the options given, only 5 and 20 are of that form.  Consider first whether it is possible to create a square with 5 pieces. Such a square would be a $5 \\times 5$ square and, as shown in the diagrams below, it is then only possible to cover the central cell in one of two ways (rotations and reflections of the arrangements shown being essentially the same). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2023_12_27_c3e6d35f61c1d1a9baefg-11.jpg?height=178&width=442&top_left_y=1096&top_left_x=812)  Whichever of these two arrangements is used to cover the central cell, it is easy to see that the remaining cells cannot be covered with four more of the pieces and hence it is impossible to build a square with 5 of the pieces shown.

What is the greatest possible integer that she can write on the top cube?",
      "answer": "118",
      "solution": "Let the integers written on the small cubes in the bottom layer be arranged as shown.  \\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \\hline$a$ & $b$ & $c$ \\\\ \\hline$d$ & $e$ & $f$ \\\\ \\hline$g$ & $h$ & $i$ \\\\ \\hline \\end{tabular}  Hence, since the integers written on the cubes in the second and third layers are the sum of the integers on the four cubes underneath, the following is written on the cubes in the second layer.  $$ \\begin{array}{|l|l|} \\hline a+b+d+e & b+c+e+f \\\\ \\hline d+e+g+h & e+f+h+i \\\\ \\hline \\end{array} $$  Therefore the integer written on the top cube is  $$ \\begin{aligned} & (a+b+d+e)+(b+c+e+f)+(d+e+g+h)+(e+f+h+i) \\\\ & \\quad=(a+b+c+d+e+f+g+h+i)+(b+d+f+h)+3 e \\end{aligned} $$  Since the sum of the integers on the bottom layer is 50 , the integer written on the top cube is equal to $50+(b+d+f+h)+3 e$. To maximise this, we first require $e$ to be as large as possible which will be obtained when the other eight integers are as small as possible. Therefore $e=50-(1+2+3+4+5+6+7+8)=14$.  Secondly, $(b+d+f+h)$ should now be made as large as possible and hence $b, d, f$ and $h$ are 5, 6, 7 and 8 in any order. Therefore $(b+d+f+h)=5+6+7+8=26$. Hence the greatest possible integer she can write on the top cube is $50+26+3 \\times 14=118$.",

      "answer": "A",
      "solution": "Note first that a small cube in the centre of a face of the large cube will only appear on one face while a cube appearing on the edge of a face of the large cube will appear on two faces and a cube appearing at a corner of the face of the large cube will appear on three faces. Hence, the total number of white faces on the edge of the large cube is an even number and the total number of white faces on the corners of the large cube is a multiple of 3 . The five faces shown contain 1 centre white face from 1 small white cube, 12 edge white faces and 5 corner white faces. Therefore, since the total number of white faces on the corners is a multiple of 3 , the missing face contains 1 or 4 white faces at its corners. None of the options contains 4 white corners so the missing face contains one white corner as in options A and E, making 6 in total. These 6 faces come from $6 \\div 3=2$ small white cubes. Both options $\\mathrm{A}$ and $\\mathrm{E}$ have two white faces on their edges, making 14 in total over the six faces from $14 \\div 2=7$ white cubes. Hence the number of white cubes whose positions we know is $1+7+2=10$. The large cube is made with 12 small white cubes so there are still two more to be placed. One can be at the centre of the large cube and the only place the remaining cube can be is at the centre of the missing face. Therefore, the missing face contains one centre white face, two edge white faces and one corner white face. Hence, the missing face is A. (This proof shows that the only possible missing face for such a cube is face A. It is left to the reader to check that the five given faces and face A can indeed be fitted together consistently to form the faces of a cube.)",
