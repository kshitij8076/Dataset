The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. However, we can split the displacement up into an infinite number of tiny parts and then approximate the force in each as being constant. Integration sums the work done in all those parts.

Then, she removed the wax and rode the snowboard straight down the hill again. She repeated the rides four more times, alternating whether she rode with a thin layer of wax on the board or not. Her friend Bob timed each ride. Linda and Bob calculated the average time it took to slide straight down the hill on the snowboard with wax compared to the average time on the snowboard without wax.\nFigure: snowboarding down a hill. Identify the question that Linda and Bob's experiment can best answer.\nChoices:\n(A) Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a thin layer of wax or a thick layer of wax?\n(B) Does Linda's snowboard slide down a hill in less time when it has a layer of wax or when it does not have a layer of wax?",

Read the passage. Then answer the question below.\n\nCooper was a landscape architect who was hired to design a new city park. The city council wanted the park to have space for outdoor concerts and to have at least 20% of the park shaded by trees. Cooper thought the concert area should be at least 150 meters from the road so traffic noise didn't interrupt the music. He developed three possible designs for the park with the concert area in a different location in each design.
