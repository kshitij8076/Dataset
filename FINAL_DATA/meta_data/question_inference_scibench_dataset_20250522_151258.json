The ore resembles pink talcum powder and is poured from a conveyor at the top of the silo. The silo is a cylinder $100 \\mathrm{ft}$ high with a radius of $200 \\mathrm{ft}$. The conveyor carries ore at a rate of $60,000 \\pi \\mathrm{~ft}^3 / \\mathrm{h}$ and the ore maintains a conical shape whose radius is 1.5 times its height.

      "question": "Calculate the maximum height change in the ocean tides caused by the Moon.",
      "answer": " 0.54",
      "solution": "\nWe continue to use our simple model of the ocean surrounding Earth. Newton proposed a solution to this calculation by imagining that two wells be dug, one along the direction of high tide (our $x$-axis) and one along the direction of low tide (our $y$-axis). If the tidal height change we want to determine is $h$, then the difference in potential energy of mass $m$ due to the height difference is $m g h$. Let's calculate the difference in work if we move the mass $m$ from point $c$ to the center of Earth and then to point $a$. This work $W$ done by gravity must equal the potential energy change $m g h$. The work $W$ is\r\n$$\r\nW=\\int_{r+\\delta_1}^0 F_{T_y} d y+\\int_0^{r+\\delta_2} F_{T_x} d x\r\n$$. The small distances $\\delta_1$ and $\\delta_2$ are to account for the small variations from a spherical Earth, but these values are so small they can be henceforth neglected. The value for $W$ becomes\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nW & =\\frac{G m M_m}{D^3}\\left[\\int_r^0(-y) d y+\\int_0^r 2 x d x\\right] \\\\\r\n& =\\frac{G m M_m}{D^3}\\left(\\frac{r^2}{2}+r^2\\right)=\\frac{3 G m M_m r^2}{2 D^3}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$\r\nBecause this work is equal to $m g h$, we have\r\n$$\r\n\\begin{aligned}\r\nm g h & =\\frac{3 G m M_m r^2}{2 D^3} \\\\\r\nh & =\\frac{3 G M_m r^2}{2 g D^3}\r\n\\end{aligned}\r\n$$\r\nNote that the mass $m$ cancels, and the value of $h$ does not depend on $m$. Nor does it depend on the substance, so to the extent Earth is plastic, similar tidal effects should be (and are) observed for the surface land. If we insert the known values of the constants into the Equation, we find\r\n$$\r\nh=\\frac{3\\left(6.67 \\times 10^{-11} \\mathrm{~m}^3 / \\mathrm{kg} \\cdot \\mathrm{s}^2\\right)\\left(7.350 \\times 10^{22} \\mathrm{~kg}\\right)\\left(6.37 \\times 10^6 \\mathrm{~m}\\right)^2}{2\\left(9.80 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^2\\right)\\left(3.84 \\times 10^8 \\mathrm{~m}\\right)^3}=0.54 \\mathrm{~m}\r\n$$\n",

      "answer": "$(\\ln 50) / 0.03$",
      "solution": "\nWe assume that salt is neither created nor destroyed in the tank. Therefore variations in the amount of salt are due solely to the flows in and out of the tank. More precisely, the rate of change of salt in the tank, $d Q / d t$, is equal to the rate at which salt is flowing in minus the rate at which it is flowing out. In symbols,\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{d Q}{d t}=\\text { rate in }- \\text { rate out }\r\n$$\r\nThe rate at which salt enters the tank is the concentration $\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{gal}$ times the flow rate $r \\mathrm{gal} / \\mathrm{min}$, or $(r / 4) \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{min}$. To find the rate at which salt leaves the tankl we need to multiply the concentration of salt in the tank by the rate of outflow, $r \\mathrm{gal} / \\mathrm{min}$. Since the rates of flow in and out are equal, the volume of water in the tank remains constant at $100 \\mathrm{gal}$, and since the mixture is \"well-stirred,\" the concentration throughout the tank is the same, namely, $[Q(t) / 100] \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{gal}$. Therefore the rate at which salt leaves the tank is $[r Q(t) / 100] \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{min}$. Thus the differential equation governing this process is\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{d Q}{d t}=\\frac{r}{4}-\\frac{r Q}{100}\r\n$$\r\nThe initial condition is\r\n$$\r\nQ(0)=Q_0\r\n$$\r\nUpon thinking about the problem physically, we might anticipate that eventually the mixture originally in the tank will be essentially replaced by the mixture flowing in, whose concentration is $\\frac{1}{4} \\mathrm{lb} / \\mathrm{gal}$. Consequently, we might expect that ultimately the amount of salt in the tank would be very close to $25 \\mathrm{lb}$. We can also find the limiting amount $Q_L=25$ by setting $d Q / d t$ equal to zero in the equation and solving the resulting algebraic equation for $Q$. Rewriting the above equation in the standard form for a linear equation, we have\r\n$$\r\n\\frac{d Q}{d t}+\\frac{r Q}{100}=\\frac{r}{4}\r\n$$\r\nThus the integrating factor is $e^{r t / 100}$ and the general solution is\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25+c e^{-r t / 100}\r\n$$\r\nwhere $c$ is an arbitrary constant. To satisfy the initial condition, we must choose $c=Q_0-25$. Therefore the solution of the initial value problem is\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25+\\left(Q_0-25\\right) e^{-r t / 100}\r\n$$\r\nor\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25\\left(1-e^{-r t / 100}\\right)+Q_0 e^{-r t / 100}\r\n$$\r\nFrom Eq., you can see that $Q(t) \\rightarrow 25$ (lb) as $t \\rightarrow \\infty$, so the limiting value $Q_L$ is 25 , confirming our physical intuition. Further, $Q(t)$ approaches the limit more rapidly as $r$ increases. In interpreting the solution, note that the second term on the right side is the portion of the original salt that remains at time $t$, while the first term gives the amount of salt in the tank due to the action of the flow processes. Now suppose that $r=3$ and $Q_0=2 Q_L=50$; then Eq. becomes\r\n$$\r\nQ(t)=25+25 e^{-0.03 t}\r\n$$\r\nSince $2 \\%$ of 25 is 0.5 , we wish to find the time $T$ at which $Q(t)$ has the value 25.5. Substituting $t=T$ and $Q=25.5$ in Eq. (8) and solving for $T$, we obtain\r\n$$\r\nT=(\\ln 50) / 0.03 \\cong 130.400766848(\\mathrm{~min}) .\r\n$$\n",

    "question": "When the force on an object depends on the position of the object, we cannot find the work done by it on the object by simply multiplying the force by the displacement. The reason is that there is no one value for the force-it changes. So, we must find the work in tiny little displacements and then add up all the work results. We effectively say, \"Yes, the force varies over any given tiny little displacement, but the variation is so small we can approximate the force as being constant during the displacement.\" Sure, it is not precise, but if we make the displacements infinitesimal, then our error becomes infinitesimal and the result becomes precise. But, to add an infinite number of work contributions by hand would take us forever, longer than a semester. So, we add them up via an integration, which allows us to do all this in minutes (much less than a semester).\r\n\r\nForce $\\vec{F}=\\left(3 x^2 \\mathrm{~N}\\right) \\hat{\\mathrm{i}}+(4 \\mathrm{~N}) \\hat{\\mathrm{j}}$, with $x$ in meters, acts on a particle, changing only the kinetic energy of the particle.
