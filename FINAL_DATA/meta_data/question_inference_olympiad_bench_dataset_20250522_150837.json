      "answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$",
      "solution": "The largest possible $C$ is $C=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $0<C \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$, Turbo can simply choose an arbitrary point $P$ (different from its starting point) to avoid. When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument. There might be even more possible examples.",

Since $\\triangle X Y Z$ is isosceles, then $X M$ (which is a median by construction) is an altitude (that is, $X M$ is perpendicular to $Y Z)$ and an angle bisector (that is, $\\angle M X Y=\\angle M X Z$ ).\n\nNow $X M$ passes through $O$ and $P$.

      "question": "In the diagram, the parabola with equation $y=x^{2}+t x-2$ intersects the $x$-axis at points $P$ and $Q$.\n\nAlso, the line with equation $y=3 x+3$ intersects the parabola at points $P$ and $R$. Determine the value of $t$ and the area of triangle $P Q R$.\n\n<image_1>",
      "answer": "-1,27",
      "solution": "Point $P$ is the point where the line $y=3 x+3$ crosses the $x$ axis, and so has coordinates $(-1,0)$.\n\nTherefore, one of the roots of the parabola $y=x^{2}+t x-2$ is $x=-1$, so\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =(-1)^{2}+t(-1)-2 \\\\\n0 & =1-t-2 \\\\\nt & =-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe parabola now has equation $y=x^{2}-x-2=(x+1)(x-2)$ (we already knew one of the roots so this helped with the factoring) and so its two $x$-intercepts are -1 and 2 , ie. $P$ has coordinates $(-1,0)$ and $Q$ has coordinates $(2,0)$.\n\nWe now have to find the coordinates of the point $R$. We know that $R$ is one of the two points of intersection of the line and the parabola, so we equate their equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 x+3 & =x^{2}-x-2 \\\\\n0 & =x^{2}-4 x-5 \\\\\n0 & =(x+1)(x-5)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(Again, we already knew one of the solutions to this equation $(x=-1)$ so this made factoring easier.) Since $R$ does not have $x$-coordinate -1 , then $R$ has $x$-coordinate $x=5$. Since $R$ lies on the line, then $y=3(5)+3=18$, so $R$ has coordinates $(5,18)$.\n\nWe can now calculate the area of triangle $P Q R$. This triangle has base of length 3 (from $P$ to $Q$ ) and height of length 18 (from the $x$-axis to $R$ ), and so has area $\\frac{1}{2}(3)(18)=27$.\n\nThus, $t=-1$ and the area of triangle $P Q R$ is 27 .",

For example, when $n=6$, full tables occur when people are seated in chairs labelled $\\{1,4\\}$ or $\\{2,5\\}$ or $\\{3,6\\}$ or $\\{1,3,5\\}$ or $\\{2,4,6\\}$. Thus, there are 5 different full tables when $n=6$.\n\n<image_1>\nA full table with $6 k+5$ chairs, for some positive integer $k$, has $t$ people seated in its chairs. Determine, in terms of $k$, the number of possible values of $t$.",

      "solution": "Suppose that $k$ is a positive integer.\n\nSuppose that $t$ people are seated at a table with $6 k+5$ chairs so that the table is full.\n\nWhen $t$ people are seated, there are $t$ gaps. Each gap consists of either 1 or 2 chairs. (A gap with 3 or more chairs can have an additional person seated in it, so the table is not full.)\n\nTherefore, there are between $t$ and $2 t$ empty chairs.\n\nThis means that the total number of chairs is between $t+t$ and $t+2 t$.\n\nIn other words, $2 t \\leq 6 k+5 \\leq 3 t$.\n\nSince $2 t \\leq 6 k+5$, then $t \\leq 3 k+\\frac{5}{2}$. Since $k$ and $t$ are integers, then $t \\leq 3 k+2$.\n\nWe note that it is possible to seat $3 k+2$ people around the table in seats\n\n$$\n\\{2,4,6, \\ldots, 6 k+2,6 k+4\\}\n$$\n\nThis table is full becase $3 k+1$ of the gaps consist of 1 chair and 1 gap consists of 2 chairs. Since $3 t \\geq 6 k+5$, then $t \\geq 2 k+\\frac{5}{3}$. Since $k$ and $t$ are integers, then $t \\geq 2 k+2$.\n\nWe note that it is possible to seat $2 k+2$ people around the table in seats\n\n$$\n\\{3,6,9, \\ldots, 6 k, 6 k+3,6 k+5\\}\n$$\n\nThis table is full becase $2 k+1$ of the gaps consist of 2 chairs and 1 gap consists of 1 chair.\n\nWe now know that, if there are $t$ people seated at a full table with $6 k+5$ chairs, then $2 k+2 \\leq t \\leq 3 k+2$.\n\nTo confirm that every such value of $t$ is possible, consider a table with $t$ people, $3 t-(6 k+5)$\n\n\n\ngaps of 1 chair, and $(6 k+5)-2 t$ gaps of 2 chairs.\n\nFrom the work above, we know that $3 t \\geq 6 k+5$ and so $3 t-(6 k+5) \\geq 0$, and that $2 t \\leq 6 k+5$ and so $(6 k+5)-2 t \\geq 0$.\n\nThe total number of gaps is $3 t-(6 k+5)+(6 k+5)-2 t=t$, since there are $t$ people seated.\n\nFinally, the total number of chairs is\n\n$$\nt+1 \\cdot(3 t-(6 k+5))+2 \\cdot((6 k+5)-2 t)=t+3 t-4 t-(6 k+5)+2(6 k+5)=6 k+5\n$$\n\nas expected.\n\nThis shows that every $t$ with $2 k+2 \\leq t \\leq 3 k+2$ can produce a full table.\n\nTherefore, the possible values of $t$ are those integers that satisfy $2 k+2 \\leq t \\leq 3 k+2$.\n\nThere are $(3 k+2)-(2 k+2)+1=k+1$ possible values of $t$.",

This quadrilateral is a rectangle since $P N$ and $Q R$ are perpendicular to the two side planes of the original solid.\n\nThus, $N R$ equals the height of $\\triangle P M N$.\n\nJoin $M$ to the midpoint $T$ of $P N$.\n\nSince $\\triangle P M N$ is isosceles, then $M T$ is perpendicular to $P N$.\n\n<img_3305>\n\nSince $N T=\\frac{1}{2} P N=1$ and $\\angle P M N=90^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle T N M=45^{\\circ}$, then $\\triangle M T N$ is also right-angled and isosceles with $M T=T N=1$.\n\nTherefore, $N R=M T=1$ and so the volume of $A B C D P Q R N$ is $2 \\cdot 1+4=6$.\n\nThe volumes of solids $P M Q A$ and $N M R B$ are equal. Each has height 2 and their bases $\\triangle P M Q$ and $\\triangle N M R$ are congruent, because each is right-angled (at $Q$ and at $R$ ) with $P Q=N R=1$ and $Q M=M R=1$.\n\nThus, using the formula above, the volume of each is $\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{1}{2}(1)(1)\\right) 2=\\frac{1}{3}$.\n\nFinally, the volume of the original solid equals $6-2 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{16}{3}$.",

We assume that the topping is added on the half pizza clockwise beginning at the angle of $\\alpha$, and that this topping stays in the same relative position as the diameter sweeps around the circle.\n\nFor what angles $\\alpha$ will there be a portion of the pizza covered with all three toppings?\n\nIf $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha<180^{\\circ}$, there will be a portion covered with three toppings; this portion is above the right half of the horizontal diameter.\n\nIf $180^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha<180^{\\circ}+\\theta$, the third diameter will pass through the two regions with angle $\\theta$ and the third topping will be below this diameter, so there will not be a region covered\n\n\n\nwith three toppings.\n\nIf $180^{\\circ}+\\theta \\leq \\alpha \\leq 360^{\\circ}$, the third topping starts to cover the leftmost part of the region currently covered with two toppings, and so a region is covered with three toppings.\n\nTherefore, for an angle $\\theta$ with $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta \\leq 180^{\\circ}$, a region of the pizza is covered with three toppings when $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\alpha<180^{\\circ}$ and when $180^{\\circ}+\\theta \\leq \\alpha \\leq 360^{\\circ}$.\n\nTo determine the desired probability, we graph points $(\\theta, \\alpha)$.

In the rest of this solution, we determine the probability using this fact and then justify this fact.\n\nSuppose that, for $1 \\leq j \\leq N$, topping $j$ is put on the semi-circle that starts at an angle of $\\theta_{j}$ clockwise from the horizontal left-hand radius and continues to an angle of $\\theta_{j}+180^{\\circ}$, where $0^{\\circ} \\leq \\theta_{j}<360^{\\circ}$. By establishing these variables and this convention, we are fixing both the angle of the diameter and the semi-circle defined by this diameter on which the topping is placed.\n\nSuppose that there is some region of the pizza with non-zero area that is covered by all $N$ toppings.\n\nThis region will be a sector with two bounding radii, each of which must be half of a diameter that defines one of the toppings.\n\nSuppose that the radius at the clockwise \"end\" of the sector is the end of the semi-circle where topping $X$ is placed, and that the radius at the counter-clockwise \"beginning\" of the sector is the start of the semi-circle where topping $Y$ is placed.\n\n\n\n<img_3683>\n\nThis means that each of the other $N-2$ toppings begins between (in the clockwise sense) the points where topping $X$ begins and where topping $Y$ begins.\n\nConsider the beginning angle for topping $X, \\theta_{X}$.\n\nTo say that the other $N-1$ toppings begin at some point before topping $X$ ends is the same as saying that each $\\theta_{j}$ with $j \\neq X$ is between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$.\n\nHere, we can allow for the possibility that $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$ is greater than $360^{\\circ}$ by saying that an angle equivalent to $\\theta_{j}$ (which is either $\\theta_{j}$ or $\\theta_{j}+360^{\\circ}$ ) is between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$. For each $j \\neq X$, the angle $\\theta_{j}$ is randomly, uniformly and independently chosen on the circle, so there is a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ that this angle (or its equivalent) will be in the semicircle between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$.\n\nSince there are $N-1$ such angles, the probability that all are between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$ is $\\frac{1}{2^{N-1}}$.\n\nSince there are $N$ possible selections for the first topping that can end the common sector, then the desired probability will be $\\frac{N}{2^{N-1}}$ as long as we can show that no set of angles can give two different sectors that are both covered with all toppings.\n\nTo show this last fact, we suppose without loss of generality that\n\n$$\n0^{\\circ}=\\theta_{1}<\\theta_{2}<\\theta_{3}<\\cdots<\\theta_{N-1}<\\theta_{N}<180^{\\circ}\n$$\n\n(We can relabel the toppings if necessary to obtain this order and rotate the pizza so that topping 1 begins at $0^{\\circ}$.)\n\nWe need to show that it is not possible to have a $Z$ for which $\\theta_{Z}, \\theta_{Z+1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{N}, \\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}, \\ldots, \\theta_{Z-1}$ all lie in a semi-circle starting with $\\theta_{Z}$.\n\nSince $\\theta_{Z}<180^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{1}$ can be thought of as $360^{\\circ}$, then this is not possible as $\\theta_{1}$ and the angles after it are all not within $180^{\\circ}$ of $\\theta_{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to have two such regions with the same set of angles, and so the desired probability is $\\frac{N}{2^{N-1}}$.",

We can think of $A C$ as its base, and its height being the distance from $B$ to the $x$-axis.\n\nIf the coordinates of $A$ are $(a, 0)$, then the base has length $4-a$ and the height is 4 .\n\nThus, $\\frac{1}{2}(4-a)(4)=4$, so $4-a=2$ and so $a=2$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of $A$ are $(2,0)$.\n\nNext, we determine the equation of the parabola.\n\nThe parabola has $x$-intercepts 2 and 4 , so has equation $y=k(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nSince the parabola passes through $(0,-4)$ as well, then $-4=k(-2)(-4)$ so $k=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the parabola has equation $y=-\\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nNext, we determine the coordinates of $D$, the vertex of the parabola.\n\nSince the $x$-intercepts are 2 and 4 , then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is the average of these, or 3.\n\n\n\nThe $y$-coordinate of $D$ can be obtained from the equation of the parabola; we obtain $y=-\\frac{1}{2}(3-2)(3-4)=-\\frac{1}{2}(1)(-1)=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the coordinates of $D$ are $\\left(3, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nLastly, we determine the area of $\\triangle B D C$, whose vertices have coordinates $B(0,-4)$, $D\\left(3, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, and $C(4,0)$.\n\nMethod 1 \n\nWe proceed be \"completing the rectangle\". That is, we draw the rectangle with horizontal sides along the lines $y=\\frac{1}{2}$ and $y=-4$ and vertical sides along the lines $x=0$ and $x=4$.

      "answer": "54",
      "solution": "We develop an explicit formula for $f(n, k)$ by building these strings.\n\nConsider the allowable strings of length $n$ that include $k$ 1's. Either $p_{n}=0$ or $p_{n}=1$.\n\nConsider first the case when $p_{n}=0$. (Here, $p_{1}$ can equal 0 or 1.)\n\nThese strings are all of the form $p_{1} p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots p_{n-1} 0$.\n\nIn this case, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nThus, these strings can all be built using $k 10$ blocks and $n-2 k 0$ blocks. This gives $k$ 1 's and $k+(n-2 k)=n-k 0$ 's. Note that any string built with these blocks will be allowable and will end with a 0 , and any such allowable string can be built in this way.\n\nThe number of ways of arranging $k$ blocks of one kind and $n-2 k$ blocks of another kind is $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+(n-2 k) \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nConsider next the case when $p_{n}=1$.\n\nHere, we must have $p_{n-1}=p_{1}=0$, since these are the two digits adjacent to $p_{n}$.\n\nThus, these strings are all of the form $0 p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots 01$.\n\nConsider the strings formed by removing the first and last digits.\n\nThese strings are allowable, are of length $n-2$, include $k-11$ 's, end with 0 , and can begin with 0 or 1 .\n\nAgain, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nTranslating our method of counting from the first case, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}(n-2)-(k-1) \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ or\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nThus, $f(n, k)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nIn order to look at divisibility, we need to first simplify the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n, k) & =\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k-1 \\\\\nk-1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-k-k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !((n-k-1)-(k-1)) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k)}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) ! k}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k+k)}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1) !}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+2)(n-2 k+1)}{k !}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that we have written $f(n, k)$ as a product, it is significantly easier to look at divisibility.\n\nNote that $2009=41 \\times 49=7^{2} \\times 41$, so we need $f(n, k)$ to be divisible by 41 and by 7 twice. For this to be the case, the numerator of $f(n, k)$ must have at least one more factor of 41 and at least two more factors of 7 than the denominator.\n\nAlso, we want to minimize $n+k$, so we work to keep $n$ and $k$ as small as possible.\n\nIf $n=49$ and $k=5$, then\n\n$$\nf(49,5)=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5 !}=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5(4)(3)(2)(1)}=49(43)(14)\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by 2009 .\n\nWe show that this pair minimizes the value of $n+k$ with a value of 54 .\n\nWe consider the possible cases by looking separately at the factors of 41 and 7 that must occur. We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ). In this case, we already know that $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ and now we also have $50+k \\leq n \\leq 48+2 k$.\n\nFor these ranges to overlap, we need $50+k \\leq 40+2 k$ and so $k \\geq 10$, which means that $n \\geq 50+k \\geq 60$, and so $n+k \\geq 70$, which is not minimal.\n\n* Next, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nHere, $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ (to include 41 in the product) and $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nSince $k$ is at least 2 by definition, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 44$, so $n$ is at least 49 .\n\nIf $n$ was 56 or more, we do not get a minimal value for $n+k$.\n\nThus, we need to have $n=49$. In this case, we do not need to look for another factor of 7 in the list.\n\nTo complete this case, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which 49 is in the range from $42+k$ to $40+2 k$ because we need to have $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nThis value of $k$ is $k=5$, which gives $n+k=49+5=54$.\n\nSince $f(49,5)$ is divisible by 2009 , as determined above, then this is the case that minimizes $n+k$, giving a value of 54 .",

      "solution": "Suppose that Karuna and Jorge meet for the first time after $t_{1}$ seconds and for the second time after $t_{2}$ seconds.\n\nWhen they meet for the first time, Karuna has run partway from $A$ to $B$ and Jorge has run partway from $B$ to $A$.\n\n<img_3496>\n\nAt this instant, the sum of the distances that they have run equals the total distance from $A$ to $B$.\n\nSince Karuna runs at $6 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ for these $t_{1}$ seconds, she has run $6 t_{1} \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nSince Jorge runs at $5 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$ for these $t_{1}$ seconds, he has run $5 t_{1} \\mathrm{~m}$.\n\nTherefore, $6 t_{1}+5 t_{1}=297$ and so $11 t_{1}=297$ or $t_{1}=27$.\n\nWhen they meet for the second time, Karuna has run from $A$ to $B$ and is running back to $A$ and Jorge has run from $B$ to $A$ and is running back to $B$. This is because Jorge gets to $A$ halfway through his run before Karuna gets back to $A$ at the end of her run.\n\n<img_3542>\n\nSince they each finish running after 99 seconds, then each has $99-t_{2}$ seconds left to run.

      "answer": "$\\frac{5 \\sqrt{39}}{3}$",
      "solution": "First consider a regular octahedron of side length 1. To compute its volume, divide it into two square-based pyramids with edges of length 1 . Such a pyramid has slant height $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and height $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its volume is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1^{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6}$. Thus the octahedron has volume twice that, or $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The result of folding the net shown is actually the image of a regular octahedron after being stretched along an axis perpendicular to one face by a factor of $r$. Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3368>\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$. Then $P Q=R_{C}-R_{I}$, where $R_{C}$ is the circumradius and $R_{I}$ the inradius of the equilateral triangle. Thus $P Q=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Then $B P^{2}=P Q^{2}+B Q^{2}=\\frac{3}{36}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{3}$, so $A P^{2}=A B^{2}-B P^{2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, and $A P=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nNow let a vertical stretch take place along an axis parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{A P}$. If the scale factor is $r$, then $A P=\\frac{r \\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and because the stretch occurs on an axis perpendicular to $\\overline{B P}$, the length $B P$ is unchanged, as can be seen below.\n\n<img_3791>\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6 r^{2}}{9}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{6 r^{2}+3}{9}$. It remains to compute $r$. But $r$ is simply the ratio of the new volume to the old volume:\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{6}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}}=\\frac{18}{\\sqrt{2}}=9 \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6(9 \\sqrt{2})^{2}+3}{9}=\\frac{975}{9}=\\frac{325}{3}$, and $A B=\\frac{5 \\sqrt{39}}{3}$.",

      "answer": "16",
      "solution": "Count the number of complete paths that pass through all vertices exactly once (such a path is called a Hamiltonian path). The set of vertices can be split into two rings:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}=\\left\\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6}\\right\\} \\text { (i.e., the inner ring), } \\quad \\mathcal{O}=\\left\\{B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{6}\\right\\} \\text { (i.e., the outer ring). }\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}=A$. The two rings are connected by the edges $E=\\left\\{A_{1} B_{1}, A_{2} B_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6} B_{6}\\right\\}$. Each vertex in the figure has exactly three edges joining it with the neighboring vertices. Also note that any closed loop must use exactly two edges (out of three) for each vertex.\n\nFurther note that a loop must use at least one edge from $E$ to move from one ring to the other. Consider two cases: the loop uses all six edges from $E$, or it uses some but not all of them.\n\nIf all edges from $E$ are used, there are two possible undirected loops. It is not possible to use both edges $A_{1} A_{2}$ and $B_{1} B_{2}$, so either $A_{1} A_{2}$ or $B_{1} B_{2}$ will be used. This choice determines how the entire loop is constructed.\n\nIf not all edges from $E$ are used, then there must be some $i$ for which the loop uses the edge $A_{i} B_{i}$ and does not use $A_{i+1} B_{i+1}$ (where $A_{j} B_{j}$ represents $A_{j-6} B_{j-6}$ if $7 \\leq j \\leq 12$ ). Because $A_{i+1}$ is only connected to three other vertices, the loop must use $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1} A_{i+2}$, and similarly must use $B_{i} B_{i+1}$ and $B_{i+1} B_{i+2}$. This also precludes using $A_{i+2} B_{i+2}$, because doing so would close the loop before it visits all 12 vertices. Therefore the loop must also use $A_{i+2} A_{i+3}$ and $B_{i+2} B_{i+3}$, which now precludes using $A_{i+3} B_{i+3}$. This continues to force the structure of the loop until it closes by using $A_{i+5} B_{i+5}=A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use exactly two edges from $E$, and they must be consecutive: $A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose those two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nThe forced path is a loop, and the only way the given conditions are satisfied if $A_{i+k}=A_{i-1}$ and $B_{i+k}=B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use (precisely) two consecutive edges from $E: A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nEach undirected loop can be traced in two ways, and thus the number of ways for Xena to trace the path is $(6+2) \\cdot 2=16$.",

Every day, the Robber stays holed up in a single hideout, and every night, the Robber moves to an adjacent hideout. Two hideouts are adjacent if and only if they are connected by an edge in the diagram, also called a hideout map (or map). For the purposes of this Power Question, the map must be connected; that is, given any two hideouts, there must be a path from one to the other. To clarify, the Robber may not stay in the same hideout for two consecutive days, although he may return to a hideout he has previously visited.

To see that 6 is minimal, note that it is possible for the Robber to go from any hideout to any other hideout in a single night. Suppose that on a given day, the Robber successfully evades capture. Without loss of generality, assume that the Robber was at hideout $A_{1}$. Then the only valid conclusion the Cops can draw is that on the next day, the Robber will not be at $A_{1}$. Thus the only hideout the Cops can afford to leave open is $A_{1}$ itself. If they leave another hideout open, the Robber might have chosen to hide there, and the process will repeat.

      "answer": "12, 8",
      "solution": "or the map $M$ from figure a, $W(M)=7$. The most efficient strategy is to use 7 Cops to blanket all the hideouts on the first day. Any strategy using fewer than 7 Cops would require 6 Cops on each of two consecutive days: given that any hideout can be reached from any other hideout, leaving more than one hideout unsearched on one day makes it is impossible to eliminate any hideouts the following day. So any other strategy would require a minimum of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nFor the map $M$ from figure b, $W(M)=8$. The strategy outlined in $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ used three Cops for a maximum of four workdays, yielding 12 Cop workdays. The most efficient strategy is to use 4 Cops, positioned at $\\{B, E, H, K\\}$ for 2 days each. The following argument demonstrates that 8 Cop workdays is in fact minimal. First, notice that there is no advantage to searching one of the hideouts between vertices of the square (for example, $C$ ) without searching the other hideout between the same vertices (for example, $D$ ). The Robber can reach $C$ on day $n$ if and only if he is at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n-1$, and in either case he could just as well go to $D$ instead of $C$. So there is no situation in which the Robber is certain to be caught at $C$ rather than at $D$. Additionally, the Robber's possible locations on day $n+1$ are the same whether he is at $C$ or $D$ on day $n$, so searching one rather than the other fails to rule out any locations for future days. So any successful strategy that involves searching $C$ should also involve searching $D$ on the same day, and similarly for $F$ and $G, I$ and $J$, and $L$ and $A$. On the other hand, if the Robber must be at one of $C$ and $D$ on day $n$, then he must be at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n+1$, because those are the only adjacent hideouts. So any strategy that involves searching both hideouts of one of the off-the-square pairs on day $n$ is equivalent to a strategy that searches the adjacent on-the-square hideouts on day $n+1$; the two strategies use the same number of Cops for the same number of workdays. Thus the optimal number of Cop workdays can be achieved using strategies that only search the \"corner\" hideouts $B, E, H, K$.\n\nRestricting the search to only those strategies searching corner hideouts $B, E, H, K$, a total of 8 workdays can be achieved by searching all four hideouts on two consecutive days: if the Robber is at one of the other eight hideouts the first day, he must move to one of the two adjacent corner hideouts the second day. But each of these corner hideouts is adjacent to two other corner hideouts. So if only one hideout is searched, for no matter how many consecutive days, the following day, the Robber could either be back at the previously-searched hideout or be at any other hideout: no possibilities are ruled out. If two adjacent corners are searched, the Cops do no better, as the following argument shows. Suppose that $B$ and $E$ are both searched for two consecutive days. Then the Cops can rule out $B, E, C$, and $D$ as possible locations, but if the Cops then switch to searching either $H$ or $K$ instead of $B$ or $E$, the Robber can go back to $C$ or $D$ within two days. So searching two adjacent corner hideouts for two days is fruitless and costs four Cop workdays. Searching diagonally opposite corner hideouts is even less fruitful, because doing so rules out none of the other hideouts as possible Robber locations. Using three Cops each day, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Robber evades capture for three days before being caught: for example, if $B, E, H$ are searched for two consecutive days, the Robber goes from $I$ or $J$ to $K$ to $L$. Therefore if three Cops are used, four days are required for a total of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nIf there are more than four Cops, the preceding arguments show that the number of Cops must be even to produce optimal results (because there is no advantage to searching one hideout between vertices of the square without searching the other). Using six Cops with four at corner hideouts yields no improvement, because the following day, the Robber could get to any of the four corner hideouts, requiring at least four Cops the second day, for ten Cop workdays. If two or fewer Cops are at corner hideouts, the situation is even worse, because if the Robber is not caught that day, he has at least nine possible hideouts the following day (depending on whether the unsearched corners are adjacent or diagonally opposite to each other). Using eight Cops (with four at corner vertices) could eliminate one corner vertex as a possible location for the second day (if the non-corner hideouts searched are on adjacent sides of the square), but eight Cop workdays have already been used on the first day. So 8 Cop workdays is minimal.",

      "solution": "The method of mass points leads to the same results as Menelaus's Theorem, but corresponds to the physical intuition that masses on opposite sides of a fulcrum balance if and only if the products of the masses and their distances from the fulcrum are equal (in physics-speak, the net torque is zero). If a mass of weight 1 is placed at vertex $B$ and masses of weight 2 are placed at vertices $A$ and $C$, then $\\triangle A B C$ balances on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{B F}$ and also on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{C E}$. Thus it balances on the point $H$ where these two lines intersect. Replacing the masses at $A$ and $C$ with a single mass of weight 4 at their center of mass $F$, the triangle still balances at $H$. Thus $B H / H F=4$.\n\nNext, consider $\\triangle B E F$. Placing masses of weight 1 at the vertices $B$ and $E$ and a mass of weight 4 at $F$, the triangle balances at $G$. A similar argument shows that $D G / G F=2$ and that $E G / G H=5$. Because $\\triangle D E G$ and $\\triangle F H G$ have congruent (vertical) angles at $G$, it follows that $[D E G] /[F H G]=(D G / F G) \\cdot(E G / H G)=2 \\cdot 5=10$.

      "solution": "The answer is 7936. The shape of this 2-signature has four peaks and three intermediate valleys:\n\n<img_3473>\n\nWe will solve this problem by building up from smaller examples. Let $f_{n}$ equal the number of $(2 n+1)$-labels whose 2 -signature consists of $n$ peaks and $n-1$ intermediate valleys. In part (b) we showed that $f_{2}=16$.

These cases are shown below.\n\n1\n\n<img_3650>\n\n<img_3227>\n\nSuppose we know the peak on which the largest number, $2 n+1$, is placed. Then that splits our picture into two shapes with fewer peaks. Once we choose which numbers from $1,2, \\ldots, 2 n$ to place each shape, we can compute the number of arrangements of the numbers on each shape, and then take the product. For example, if we place the 9 at the second peak, as shown below, we get a 1-peak shape on the left and a 2-peak shape on the right.\n\n<img_4030>\n\nFor the above shape, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}8 \\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right)$ ways to pick the three numbers to place on the left-hand side, $f_{1}=2$ ways to place them, and $f_{2}=16$ ways to place the remaining five numbers on the right.\n\nThis argument works for any $n>1$, so we have shown the following:\n\n$$\nf_{n}=\\sum_{k=1}^{n}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n2 n \\\\\n2 k-1\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{k-1} f_{n-k}\n$$\n\n\n\nSo we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& f_{1}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n2 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{0}^{2}=2 \\\\\n& f_{2}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n4 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{0} f_{1}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n4 \\\\\n3\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{1} f_{0}=16 \\\\\n& f_{3}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n6 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{0} f_{2}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n6 \\\\\n3\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{1}^{2}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n6 \\\\\n5\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{2} f_{0}=272 \\\\\n& f_{4}=\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n8 \\\\\n1\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{0} f_{3}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n8 \\\\\n3\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{1} f_{2}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n8 \\\\\n5\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{2} f_{1}+\\left(\\begin{array}{l}\n8 \\\\\n7\n\\end{array}\\right) f_{3} f_{0}=7936 .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$",

      "answer": "$p ! \\cdot p^{n-p}$",
      "solution": "The answer is $p ! \\cdot p^{n-p}$.\n\nCall two consecutive windows in a $p$-signature compatible if the last $p-1$ numbers in the first label and the first $p-1$ numbers in the second label (their \"overlap\") describe the same ordering. For example, in the $p$-signature $(. ., 2143,2431, \\ldots), 2143$ and 2431 are compatible. Notice that the last three digits of 2143 and the first three digits of 2431 can be described by the same 3-label, 132 .\n\nTheorem: A signature $\\sigma$ is possible if and only if every pair of consecutive windows is compatible.\n\nProof: $(\\Rightarrow)$ Consider a signature $\\sigma$ describing a $p$-label $L$. If some pair in $\\sigma$ is not compatible, then there is some string of $p-1$ numbers in our label $L$ that has two different $(p-1)$-signatures. This is impossible, since the $p$-signature is well-defined.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\\sigma$ is a $p$-signature such that that every pair of consecutive windows is compatible. We need to show that there is at least one label $L$ with $S_{p}[L]=\\sigma$. We do so by induction on the number of windows in $\\sigma$, using the results from $5(\\mathrm{~b})$.\n\nLet $\\sigma=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$, and suppose $\\omega_{1}=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{p}$. Set $L_{1}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nSuppose that $L_{k}$ is a $(p+k-1)$-label such that $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}\\right\\}$. We will construct $L_{k+1}$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k+1}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAs in $5(\\mathrm{~b})$, denote by $L_{k}^{(j)}$ the label $L_{k}$ with a $j+0.5$ appended; we will eventually renumber the elements in the label to make them all integers. Appending $j+0.5$ does not affect any of the non-terminal windows of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]$, and as $j$ varies from 0 to $p-k+1$ the final window of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$ varies over each of the $p$ windows compatible with $\\omega_{k}$. Since $\\omega_{k+1}$ is compatible with $\\omega_{k}$, there exists some $j$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$. Now we renumber as follows: set $L_{k+1}=S_{k+p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$, which replaces $L_{k}^{(j)}$ with the integers 1 through $k+p$ and preserves the relative order of all integers in the label.\n\nBy continuing this process, we conclude that the $n$-label $L_{n-p+1}$ has $p$-signature $\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is possible.\n\nTo count the number of possible $p$-signatures, we choose the first window ( $p$ ! choices), then choose each of the remaining $n-p$ compatible windows ( $p$ choices each). In all, there are $p ! \\cdot p^{n-p}$ possible $p$-signatures.",

      "answer": "16",
      "solution": "The answer is $p=16$. To show this fact we will need to extend the idea from part 8(b) about \"linking\" inequalities forced by the various windows:\n\nTheorem: A $p$-signature for an $n$-label $L$ is unique if and only if for every $k<n, k$ and $k+1$ are in at least one window together. That is, the distance between them in the $n$-label is less than $p$.\n\nProof: Suppose that for some $k$, the distance between $k$ and $k+1$ is $p$ or greater. Then the label $L^{\\prime}$ obtained by swapping $k$ and $k+1$ has the same $p$-signature, because there are no numbers between $k$ and $k+1$ in any window and because the two numbers never appear in the same window.\n\nIf the distance between all such pairs is less than $k$, we need to show that $S_{p}[L]$ is unique. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, let $r_{i}$ denote the position where $i$ appears in $L$. For example, if $L=4123$, then $r_{1}=2, r_{2}=3, r_{3}=4$, and $r_{4}=1$.\n\nLet $L=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$. Since 1 and 2 are in some window together, $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}$. Similarly, for any $k$, since $k$ and $k+1$ are in some window together, $a_{r_{k}}<a_{r_{k+1}}$. We then get a linked inequality $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}<\\cdots<a_{r_{n}}$, which can only be satisfied if $a_{r_{1}}=1, a_{r_{2}}=$ $2, \\ldots, a_{r_{n}}=n$. Therefore, $S_{p}[L]$ is unique.\n\nFrom the proof above, we know that the signature is unique if and only if every pair of consecutive integers coexists in at least one window. Therefore, we seek the largest distance between consecutive integers in $L$. That distance is 15 (from 8 to 9 , and from 17 to 18). Thus the smallest $p$ is 16 .",

      "answer": "32",
      "solution": "We say that two numbers are neighbors if they occupy adjacent squares, and that $a$ is a friend of $b$ if $0<|a-b| \\leq 2$. Using this vocabulary, the problem's condition is that every pair of neighbors must be friends of each other. Each of the numbers 1 and 8 has two friends, and each number has at most four friends.\n\nIf there is no number written in the center square, then we must have one of the cycles in the figures below. For each cycle, there are 8 rotations. Thus there are 16 possible configurations with no number written in the center square.\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 4 | - | 5 |\n| 6 | 8 | 7 |\n\n\n| 3 | 1 | 2 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 5 | - | 4 |\n| 7 | 8 | 6 |\n\nNow assume that the center square contains the number $n$. Because $n$ has at least three neighbors, $n \\neq 1$ and $n \\neq 8$. First we show that 1 must be in a corner. If 1 is a neighbor of $n$, then one of the corners neighboring 1 must be empty, because 1 has only two friends ( 2 and $3)$. If $c$ is in the other corner neighboring 1 , then $\\{n, c\\}=\\{2,3\\}$. But then $n$ must have three\n\n\n\nmore friends $\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}\\right)$ other than 1 and $c$, for a total of five friends, which is impossible, as illustrated below. Therefore 1 must be in a corner.\n\n| - | 1 | $c$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $n_{1}$ | $n$ | $n_{2}$ |\n|  | $n_{3}$ |  |\n\nNow we show that 1 can only have one neighbor, i.e., one of the squares adjacent to 1 is empty. If 1 has two neighbors, then we have, up to a reflection and a rotation, the configuration shown below. Because 2 has only one more friend, the corner next to 2 is empty and $n=4$. Consequently, $m_{1}=5$ (refer to the figure below). Then 4 has one friend (namely 6) left with two neighbors $m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$, which is impossible. Thus 1 must have exactly one neighbor. An analogous argument shows that 8 must also be at a corner with exactly one neighbor.\n\n| 1 | 2 | - |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 3 | $n$ | $m_{3}$ |\n| $m_{1}$ | $m_{2}$ |  |\n\nTherefore, 8 and 1 must be in non-opposite corners, with the blank square between them. Thus, up to reflections and rotations, the only possible configuration is the one shown at left below.\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $m$ |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $2 / 3$ | $4 / 5$ | $6 / 7$ |\n| $3 / 2$ | $5 / 4$ | $7 / 6$ |\n\nThere are two possible values for $m$, namely 2 and 3 . For each of the cases $m=2$ and $m=3$, the rest of the configuration is uniquely determined, as illustrated in the figure above right. We summarize our process: there are four corner positions for 1; two (non-opposite) corner positions for 8 (after 1 is placed); and two choices for the number in the square neighboring 1 but not neighboring 8 . This leads to $4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=16$ distinct configurations with a number written in the center square.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 configurations in which the center square is blank and 16 configurations with a number in the center square, for a total of $\\mathbf{3 2}$ distinct configurations.",

If $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, n)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+1, n)+\\cdots+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k, n)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n+1)$, then adding $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n)$ to both sides yields $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+1, n+1)=$ $\\mathrm{Pa}(n+k+2, n+1)$ by the recursive rule for $\\mathrm{Pa}$.",

      "answer": "21",
      "solution": "Let us consider $N=1$ equilateral triangles. From inspection, we need to place the triangle such that the center of mass lies at the edge of the table. The maximum overhang in this case is $(1-f) h$ where $h=\\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the height of the triangle and $f h=\\frac{h}{3}$ is the location of the center of mass.\nIf we wish to place a second triangle on top, we want to maximize the center of mass to be as far right as possible without the top block toppling. Placing the second block such that its center of mass is at the tip of the first triangle accomplishes this. However, the center of mass of the two triangles combined is now past the edge. Their center of mass is:\n\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\frac{f h+h}{2}=\\frac{f+1}{2} h\n$$\n\nThus the maximum overhang of the first block is now:\n\n$$\nh-\\frac{f+1}{2} h=\\frac{1-f}{2} h\n$$\n\nNow, we will place a third block such that it has the maximum overhang with respect to the top block and then shift the entire setup so that the center of mass of the system lies at the edge of the table. Following the same procedures, we find that the maximum overhang of the first block is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-f}{3} h\n$$\n\nThe overhang of the top two blocks are $(1-f) h$ and $\\frac{1-f}{2} h$, unchanged from earlier. You can show via induction that the maximum overhang of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ block (counting from the top downwards) is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-f}{n} h\n$$\n\nso if there are 20 such blocks, then the total overhang (summing over all the blocks) is:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{20} \\frac{1-f}{k} h=(1-f) h H_{20}=\\frac{2}{3} \\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{2} H_{20}=\\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{3} H_{20}=20.77 \\mathrm{~cm} \\approx 21 \\mathrm{~cm}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{N}$ is the $N^{\\text {th }}$ harmonic number.",

      "answer": "1",
      "solution": "The solution revolves around the idea that when the acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity, the work done is 0 , and thus, the instantaneous rate of change of the magnitude of velocity $v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}$ is 0 . Thus, at such points, when the vertical velocity is plotted against the horizontal velocity, the curve will be tangent to a circle centered at the origin because $v_{y}^{2}+v_{x}^{2}$ is nonchanging at that instant.\nThis is equivalent to stating that the line from the origin to the curve is perpendicular to the curve.

Around the planet is a strange moon of orbital radius $R_{s}=$ $6,400,000 \\mathrm{~m}\\left(R_{s} \\gg R_{p}\\right)$ and mass $M_{s}=9.346 \\times 10^{19} \\mathrm{~kg}\\left(M_{s} \\ll M_{p}\\right)$. The moon can be modelled as a blackbody and absorbs light perfectly. Darth Vader is in the same plane that the planet orbits in. Startled, Darth Vader shoots a laser with constant intensity and power $P_{0}=2 \\times 10^{32} \\mathrm{~W}$ at the reflective planet and hits the planet a distance of $\\frac{R_{p}}{2}$ away from the line from him to the center of the planet. Upon hitting the reflective planet, the light from the laser is plane polarized. The angle of the planet's polarizer is always the same as the angle of reflection. After reflectance, the laser lands a direct hit on the insulator planet. Darth Vader locks the laser in on the planet until it moves right in front of him, when he turns the laser off. Determine the energy absorbed by the satellite. Assume the reflective planet remains stationary and that the reflective planet is a perfect polarizer of light.\n\n<image_1>",

By Malus' Law, when the laser hits the planet with an angle $\\theta$, the final power after reflection is $P_{0} \\cos ^{2}(\\theta)$. Also, note that the satellite has to be at an angle $2 \\theta$ due to the law of reflection. Therefore, by Kepler's Third law, the time for the satellite to reach $\\theta=0$ is\n$$\nt=2 \\theta \\sqrt{\\frac{r^{3}}{G M_{p}}} \\Longrightarrow d t=2 \\sqrt{\\frac{r^{3}}{G M_{p}}} d \\theta\n$$\n\nThus, the total power absorbed by the satellite is\n\n$$\n\\int_{0}^{\\theta_{0}} P_{0} \\cos ^{2}(\\theta) d t=2 P_{0} \\sqrt{\\frac{r^{3}}{G M_{p}}} \\int_{0}^{\\theta_{0}} \\cos ^{2}(\\theta) d \\theta=P_{0} \\sqrt{\\frac{r^{3}}{G M_{p}}}\\left(\\theta_{0}+\\sin \\left(\\theta_{0}\\right) \\cos \\left(\\theta_{0}\\right)\\right)=1.33 \\cdot 10^{35} \\mathrm{~J} .\n$$",

      "solution": "Our first goal is to find an expression for the power curve $P(v)$. To do this, let us select a few points on the curve. The easiest point to pick is $(0,0)$ since it is fixed at the origin. The next two easiest points to pick are those that are on the lines $x=3$ and $x=6$ which are given as approximately $(3,1.8)$ and $(6,7.2)$. Note that $y$-axis is in units of $100 \\mathrm{~W}$ so in reality these two points are given as $(3,180)$ and $(6,720)$. This curve is resemblant of a quadratic in the form of $y=k_{1} x^{2}$ and upon solving for $k_{1}$ we find that the curve is given as $P=20 v^{2}$. Secondly, the next line remains constant with respect to time as a line $P=900$. Therefore, we can write a piecewise function for power defined by\n$$\nP(v)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n20 v^{2} & \\text { if } v \\geq 0, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v<6 \\\\\n900 & \\text { if } v \\geq 6\n\\end{array} .\\right.\n$$\n\n\n\nWe need to find the relationship between power, velocity, and displacement of Mario. Consider dividing the displacement into tiny rectangular pieces with width $\\Delta t$ such that\n\n$$\ns=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\Delta s_{i}=\\sum_{i} v_{i}(t) \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$\n\nWe want to the displacement to be expressed in terms without $\\Delta t$. This means that we have to find a relationship for $\\Delta t$. Note that\n\n$$\n\\Delta t=\\Delta v \\cdot \\frac{\\Delta t}{\\Delta v}=\\Delta v \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\Delta v / \\Delta t}=\\frac{\\Delta v}{a}\n$$\n\nTherefore, we now know the displacement to be expressed as\n\n$$\ns=\\sum_{i \\rightarrow 0} v_{i}(t) \\frac{\\Delta v}{a}=\\int \\frac{v}{a(v)} d v\n$$\n\nTo find an expression for $a(v)$ in terms of power, we note that\n\n$$\nP(v)=F(v) \\cdot v \\Longrightarrow a(v)=\\frac{P(v)}{v m}\n$$\n\nwhich means that upon substituting,\n\n$$\ns=\\int \\frac{v^{2} m}{P(v)} d v \\Longrightarrow s=\\int_{0}^{6} \\frac{89 v^{2}}{20 v^{2}} d v+\\int_{6}^{9} \\frac{89 v^{2}}{900} d v=43.61 \\approx 40 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$",

      "answer": "39",
      "solution": "Define point $O$ as the point in the plane that the axis of rotation passes through. Since moments of inertia simply add about a given axis, we can calculate the moments of inertia of the three \"sectors\" whose union forms the given area and subtract twice the moment of inertia of the triangle, so our answer will be $3 I_{s, O}-2 I_{t, O}$.\nClaim: The center of mass of a sector is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the vertex of the sector along its axis of symmetry. Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It's well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$. Then, the $x$-coordinate of a point on the arc whose corresponding radius makes an angle of $\\theta$ with the axis of symmetry is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta)$. We can integrate this over all possible angles $\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$ and then divide by the range $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ to get the average $x$-coordinate, or the center of mass.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)-\\sin \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\n\nThis concludes the proof.\n\nNow define point $X$ as the vertex of a sector and point $M$ as the center of mass of that sector. According to the parallel axis theorem,\n\n$$\nI_{s, X}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n. It's well known that $I_{s, X}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{s} r^{2}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}$, and so\n\n$$\nI_{s, M}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}-\\frac{4 m_{s}}{\\pi^{2}}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}-8}{2 \\pi^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's also well known that $O$ is on the line of symmetry and a distance of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ away from $X$, and so $M X=$ $\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nI_{s, O}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's well known that, since $O$ is the center of mass of the triangle,\n\n$$\nI_{t, O}=\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\nNow we just need to calculate $m_{s}$. Since the mass of the triangle is $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$, this is equivalent to finding the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of a triangle. Through geometry, this is found to be $\\frac{2 \\pi}{3 \\sqrt{3}}$. Finally, we get our answer to be\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)-\\frac{1}{6}=\\left(\\frac{10 \\pi-17 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $a+b+c+d+e=10+17+3+6+3=039$",
