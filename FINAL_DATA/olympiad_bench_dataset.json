    "question": "Turbo the snail sits on a point on a circle with circumference 1. Given an infinite sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$. Turbo successively crawls distances $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ around the circle, each time choosing to crawl either clockwise or counterclockwise.\n\nFor example, if the sequence $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ is $0.4,0.6,0.3, \\ldots$, then Turbo may start crawling as follows:\n<image_1>\n\nDetermine the largest constant $C>0$ with the following property: for every sequence of positive real numbers $c_{1}, c_{2}, c_{3}, \\ldots$ with $c_{i}<C$ for all $i$, Turbo can (after studying the sequence) ensure that there is some point on the circle that it will never visit or crawl across.",
    "answer": "$\\frac{1}{2}$",
    "solution": "The largest possible $C$ is $C=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nFor $0<C \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$, Turbo can simply choose an arbitrary point $P$ (different from its starting point) to avoid. When Turbo is at an arbitrary point $A$ different from $P$, the two arcs $A P$ have total length 1; therefore, the larger of the two the arcs (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ) must have length $\\geqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. By always choosing this larger arc (or either arc in case $A$ is diametrically opposite to $P$ ), Turbo will manage to avoid the point $P$ forever.\n\nFor $C>\\frac{1}{2}$, we write $C=\\frac{1}{2}+a$ with $a>0$, and we choose the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1+a}{2}, \\quad \\frac{1}{2}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nIn other words, $c_{i}=\\frac{1}{2}$ if $i$ is odd and $c_{i}=\\frac{1+a}{2}<C$ when $i$ is even. We claim Turbo must eventually visit all points on the circle. This is clear when it crawls in the same direction two times in a row; after all, we have $c_{i}+c_{i+1}>1$ for all $i$. Therefore, we are left with the case that Turbo alternates crawling clockwise and crawling counterclockwise. If it, without loss of generality, starts by going clockwise, then it will always crawl a distance $\\frac{1}{2}$ clockwise followed by a distance $\\frac{1+a}{2}$ counterclockwise. The net effect is that it crawls a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise. Because $\\frac{a}{2}$ is positive, there exists a positive integer $N$ such that $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$. After $2 N$ crawls, Turbo will have crawled a distance $\\frac{a}{2}$ counterclockwise $N$ times, therefore having covered a total distance of $\\frac{a}{2} \\cdot N>1$, meaning that it must have crawled over all points on the circle.\n\nNote: Every sequence of the form $c_{i}=x$ if $i$ is odd, and $c_{i}=y$ if $i$ is even, where $0<x, y<C$, such that $x+y \\geqslant 1$, and $x \\neq y$ satisfies the conditions with the same argument. There might be even more possible examples.",

    "question": "In the diagram, the parabola with equation $y=x^{2}+t x-2$ intersects the $x$-axis at points $P$ and $Q$.\n\nAlso, the line with equation $y=3 x+3$ intersects the parabola at points $P$ and $R$. Determine the value of $t$ and the area of triangle $P Q R$.\n\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "-1,27",
    "solution": "Point $P$ is the point where the line $y=3 x+3$ crosses the $x$ axis, and so has coordinates $(-1,0)$.\n\nTherefore, one of the roots of the parabola $y=x^{2}+t x-2$ is $x=-1$, so\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n0 & =(-1)^{2}+t(-1)-2 \\\\\n0 & =1-t-2 \\\\\nt & =-1\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe parabola now has equation $y=x^{2}-x-2=(x+1)(x-2)$ (we already knew one of the roots so this helped with the factoring) and so its two $x$-intercepts are -1 and 2 , ie. $P$ has coordinates $(-1,0)$ and $Q$ has coordinates $(2,0)$.\n\nWe now have to find the coordinates of the point $R$. We know that $R$ is one of the two points of intersection of the line and the parabola, so we equate their equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n3 x+3 & =x^{2}-x-2 \\\\\n0 & =x^{2}-4 x-5 \\\\\n0 & =(x+1)(x-5)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n(Again, we already knew one of the solutions to this equation $(x=-1)$ so this made factoring easier.) Since $R$ does not have $x$-coordinate -1 , then $R$ has $x$-coordinate $x=5$. Since $R$ lies on the line, then $y=3(5)+3=18$, so $R$ has coordinates $(5,18)$.\n\nWe can now calculate the area of triangle $P Q R$. This triangle has base of length 3 (from $P$ to $Q$ ) and height of length 18 (from the $x$-axis to $R$ ), and so has area $\\frac{1}{2}(3)(18)=27$.\n\nThus, $t=-1$ and the area of triangle $P Q R$ is 27 .",

This is because $N R$ and $B C$ are parallel (since they lie in parallel planes), which makes $N R B C$ a trapezoid. Similarly, $P Q A D$ is a trapezoid. Also, $P N, Q R, D C$, and $A B$ are all perpendicular to the planes of these trapezoids and equal in length, since they equal the side lengths of the squares.\n\nSolids $P M Q A$ and $N M R B$ are triangular-based pyramids. We can think of their bases as being $\\triangle P M Q$ and $\\triangle N M R$. Their heights are each equal to 2 , the height of the original solid.

    "question": "Points $A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{N}$ are equally spaced around the circumference of a circle and $N \\geq 3$. Three of these points are selected at random and a triangle is formed using these points as its vertices.\n\nThrough this solution, we will use the following facts:\n\nWhen an acute triangle is inscribed in a circle:\n\n- each of the three angles of the triangle is the angle inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended,\n- each of the three arcs into which the circle is divided by the vertices of the triangles is less than half of the circumference of the circle, and\n- it contains the centre of the circle.\n\nWhy are these facts true?\n\n- Consider a chord of a circle which is not a diameter.\n\nThen the angle subtended in the major arc of this circle is an acute angle and the angle subtended in the minor arc is an obtuse angle.\n\nNow consider an acute triangle inscribed in a circle.\n\nSince each angle of the triangle is acute, then each of the three angles is inscribed in the major arc defined by the side of the triangle by which it is subtended.\n\n- It follows that each arc of the circle that is outside the triangle must be a minor arc, thus less than the circumference of the circle.\n- Lastly, if the centre was outside the triangle, then we would be able to draw a diameter of the circle with the triangle entirely on one side of the diameter.\n\n<image_1>\n\nIn this case, one of the arcs of the circle cut off by one of the sides of the triangle would have to be a major arc, which cannot happen, because of the above.\n\nTherefore, the centre is contained inside the triangle.\nIf $N=7$, what is the probability that the triangle is acute? (A triangle is acute if each of its three interior angles is less than $90^{\\circ}$.)",

    "solution": "Since there are $N=7$ points from which the triangle's vertices can be chosen, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{l}7 \\\\ 3\\end{array}\\right)=35$ triangles in total.\n\nWe compute the number of acute triangles.\n\nFix one of the vertices of such a triangle at $A_{1}$.\n\nWe construct the triangle by choosing the other two vertices in ascending subscript order. We choose the vertices by considering the arc length from the previous vertex - each of\n\n\n\nthese arc lengths must be smaller than half the total circumference of the circle.\n\nSince there are 7 equally spaced points on the circle, we assume the circumference is 7 , so the arc length formed by each side must be at most 3 .\n\nSince the first arc length is at most 3 , the second point can be only $A_{2}, A_{3}$ or $A_{4}$.\n\nIf the second point is $A_{2}$, then since the second and third arc lengths are each at most 3 , then the third point must be $A_{5}$. (Since the second arc length is at most 3, then the third point cannot be any further along than $A_{5}$. However, the arc length from $A_{5}$ around to $A_{1}$ is 3 , so it cannot be any closer than $A_{5}$.)\n\n<img_4024>\n\nIf the second point is $A_{3}$, the third point must be $A_{5}$ or $A_{6}$. If the second point is $A_{4}$, the third point must be $A_{5}$ or $A_{6}$ or $A_{7}$. Therefore, there are 6 acute triangles which include $A_{1}$ as one of its vertices.\n\nHow many acute triangles are there in total?\n\nWe can repeat the above process for each of the 6 other points, giving $7 \\times 6=42$ acute triangles.\n\nBut each triangle is counted three times here, as it has been counted once for each of its vertices.\n\nThus, there are $\\frac{7 \\times 6}{3}=14$ acute triangles.\n\nTherefore, the probability that a randomly chosen triangle is acute if $\\frac{14}{35}=\\frac{2}{5}$.",

By establishing these variables and this convention, we are fixing both the angle of the diameter and the semi-circle defined by this diameter on which the topping is placed.\n\nSuppose that there is some region of the pizza with non-zero area that is covered by all $N$ toppings.\n\nThis region will be a sector with two bounding radii, each of which must be half of a diameter that defines one of the toppings.\n\nSuppose that the radius at the clockwise \"end\" of the sector is the end of the semi-circle where topping $X$ is placed, and that the radius at the counter-clockwise \"beginning\" of the sector is the start of the semi-circle where topping $Y$ is placed.\n\n\n\n<img_3683>\n\nThis means that each of the other $N-2$ toppings begins between (in the clockwise sense) the points where topping $X$ begins and where topping $Y$ begins.\n\nConsider the beginning angle for topping $X, \\theta_{X}$.\n\nTo say that the other $N-1$ toppings begin at some point before topping $X$ ends is the same as saying that each $\\theta_{j}$ with $j \\neq X$ is between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$.\n\nHere, we can allow for the possibility that $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$ is greater than $360^{\\circ}$ by saying that an angle equivalent to $\\theta_{j}$ (which is either $\\theta_{j}$ or $\\theta_{j}+360^{\\circ}$ ) is between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$. For each $j \\neq X$, the angle $\\theta_{j}$ is randomly, uniformly and independently chosen on the circle, so there is a probability of $\\frac{1}{2}$ that this angle (or its equivalent) will be in the semicircle between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$.\n\nSince there are $N-1$ such angles, the probability that all are between $\\theta_{X}$ and $\\theta_{X}+180^{\\circ}$ is $\\frac{1}{2^{N-1}}$.\n\nSince there are $N$ possible selections for the first topping that can end the common sector, then the desired probability will be $\\frac{N}{2^{N-1}}$ as long as we can show that no set of angles can give two different sectors that are both covered with all toppings.\n\nTo show this last fact, we suppose without loss of generality that\n\n$$\n0^{\\circ}=\\theta_{1}<\\theta_{2}<\\theta_{3}<\\cdots<\\theta_{N-1}<\\theta_{N}<180^{\\circ}\n$$\n\n(We can relabel the toppings if necessary to obtain this order and rotate the pizza so that topping 1 begins at $0^{\\circ}$.)\n\nWe need to show that it is not possible to have a $Z$ for which $\\theta_{Z}, \\theta_{Z+1}, \\ldots, \\theta_{N}, \\theta_{1}, \\theta_{2}, \\ldots, \\theta_{Z-1}$ all lie in a semi-circle starting with $\\theta_{Z}$.\n\nSince $\\theta_{Z}<180^{\\circ}$ and $\\theta_{1}$ can be thought of as $360^{\\circ}$, then this is not possible as $\\theta_{1}$ and the angles after it are all not within $180^{\\circ}$ of $\\theta_{Z}$.\n\nTherefore, it is not possible to have two such regions with the same set of angles, and so the desired probability is $\\frac{N}{2^{N-1}}$.",

We can think of $A C$ as its base, and its height being the distance from $B$ to the $x$-axis.\n\nIf the coordinates of $A$ are $(a, 0)$, then the base has length $4-a$ and the height is 4 .\n\nThus, $\\frac{1}{2}(4-a)(4)=4$, so $4-a=2$ and so $a=2$.\n\nTherefore, the coordinates of $A$ are $(2,0)$.\n\nNext, we determine the equation of the parabola.\n\nThe parabola has $x$-intercepts 2 and 4 , so has equation $y=k(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nSince the parabola passes through $(0,-4)$ as well, then $-4=k(-2)(-4)$ so $k=-\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nTherefore, the parabola has equation $y=-\\frac{1}{2}(x-2)(x-4)$.\n\nNext, we determine the coordinates of $D$, the vertex of the parabola.\n\nSince the $x$-intercepts are 2 and 4 , then the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is the average of these, or 3.\n\n\n\nThe $y$-coordinate of $D$ can be obtained from the equation of the parabola; we obtain $y=-\\frac{1}{2}(3-2)(3-4)=-\\frac{1}{2}(1)(-1)=\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThus, the coordinates of $D$ are $\\left(3, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$.\n\nLastly, we determine the area of $\\triangle B D C$, whose vertices have coordinates $B(0,-4)$, $D\\left(3, \\frac{1}{2}\\right)$, and $C(4,0)$.\n\nMethod 1 \n\nWe proceed be \"completing the rectangle\".

To find the $x$-coordinate of $E$, we set $y=0$ to obtain $0=\\frac{3}{2} x-4$ or $\\frac{3}{2} x=4$ or $x=\\frac{8}{3}$.\n\nWe think of $E C$ as the base of each of the two smaller triangles.

    "solution": "We develop an explicit formula for $f(n, k)$ by building these strings.\n\nConsider the allowable strings of length $n$ that include $k$ 1's. Either $p_{n}=0$ or $p_{n}=1$.\n\nConsider first the case when $p_{n}=0$. (Here, $p_{1}$ can equal 0 or 1.)\n\nThese strings are all of the form $p_{1} p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots p_{n-1} 0$.\n\nIn this case, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nThus, these strings can all be built using $k 10$ blocks and $n-2 k 0$ blocks. This gives $k$ 1 's and $k+(n-2 k)=n-k 0$ 's. Note that any string built with these blocks will be allowable and will end with a 0 , and any such allowable string can be built in this way.\n\nThe number of ways of arranging $k$ blocks of one kind and $n-2 k$ blocks of another kind is $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}k+(n-2 k) \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$, which simplifies to $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)$.\n\nConsider next the case when $p_{n}=1$.\n\nHere, we must have $p_{n-1}=p_{1}=0$, since these are the two digits adjacent to $p_{n}$.\n\nThus, these strings are all of the form $0 p_{2} p_{3} \\cdots 01$.\n\nConsider the strings formed by removing the first and last digits.\n\nThese strings are allowable, are of length $n-2$, include $k-11$ 's, end with 0 , and can begin with 0 or 1 .\n\nAgain, since a 1 is always followed by a 0 and the strings end with 0 , we can build these strings using blocks of the form 10 and 0 . Any combination of these blocks will be an allowable string, as each 1 will always be both preceded and followed by a 0 .\n\nTranslating our method of counting from the first case, there are $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}(n-2)-(k-1) \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ or\n\n\n\n$\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nThus, $f(n, k)=\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k \\\\ k\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}n-k-1 \\\\ k-1\\end{array}\\right)$ such strings.\n\nIn order to look at divisibility, we need to first simplify the formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(n, k) & =\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)+\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\nn-k-1 \\\\\nk-1\n\\end{array}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-k-k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !((n-k-1)-(k-1)) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k) !}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) !}{(k-1) !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k)}{k !(n-2 k) !}+\\frac{(n-k-1) ! k}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{(n-k-1) !(n-k+k)}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1) !}{k !(n-2 k) !} \\\\\n& =\\frac{n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+2)(n-2 k+1)}{k !}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNow that we have written $f(n, k)$ as a product, it is significantly easier to look at divisibility.\n\nNote that $2009=41 \\times 49=7^{2} \\times 41$, so we need $f(n, k)$ to be divisible by 41 and by 7 twice. For this to be the case, the numerator of $f(n, k)$ must have at least one more factor of 41 and at least two more factors of 7 than the denominator.\n\nAlso, we want to minimize $n+k$, so we work to keep $n$ and $k$ as small as possible.\n\nIf $n=49$ and $k=5$, then\n\n$$\nf(49,5)=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5 !}=\\frac{49(43)(42)(41)(40)}{5(4)(3)(2)(1)}=49(43)(14)\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by 2009 .\n\nWe show that this pair minimizes the value of $n+k$ with a value of 54 .\n\nWe consider the possible cases by looking separately at the factors of 41 and 7 that must occur. We focus on the factor of 41 first.\n\nFor the numerator to contain a factor of 41 , either $n$ is divisible by 41 or one of the terms in the product $(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)$ is divisible by 41 .\n\nCase 1: $n$ is divisible by 41\n\nWe already know that $n=82$ is too large, so we consider $n=41$. From the original interpretation of $f(n, k)$, we see that $k \\leq 20$, as there can be no more than 20 gifts placed on 41 plates.\n\nHere, the numerator becomes 41 times the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers, the largest of which is $40-k$.\n\nNow the numerator must also contain at least two factors of 7 more than the denominator. But the denominator is the product of $k$ consecutive integers. Since the numerator contains the product of $k-1$ consecutive integers and the denominator contains the product of $k$ consecutive integers, then the denominator will always include at least as many multiples of 7 as the numerator (since there are more consecutive integers in the product in the denominator). Thus, it is impossible for the numerator to contain even one more\n\n\n\nadditional factor of 7 than the denominator.\n\nTherefore, if $n=41$, then $f(n, k)$ cannot be divisible by 2009 .\n\nCase 2: $n$ is not divisible by 41\n\nThis means that the factor of 41 in the numerator must occur in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case, the integer 41 must occur in this product, since an occurrence of 82 would make $n$ greater than 82 , which does not minimize $n+k$.\n\nSo we try to find values of $n$ and $k$ that include the integer 41 in this list.\n\nNote that $n-k-1$ is the largest factor in the product and $n-2 k+1$ is the smallest.\n\nSince 41 is contained somewhere in the product, then $n-2 k+1 \\leq 41$ (giving $n \\leq 40+2 k$ ) and $41 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 42+k$ ).\n\nCombining these restrictions, we get $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nNow, we focus on the factors of 7 .\n\nEither $n$ is not divisible by 7 or $n$ is divisible by 7 .\n\n* If $n$ is not divisible by 7 , then at least two factors of 7 must be included in the product\n\n$$\n(n-k-1)(n-k-2) \\cdots(n-2 k+1)\n$$\n\nwhich means that either $k \\geq 8$ (to give two multiples of 7 in this list of $k-1$ consecutive integers) or one of the factors is divisible by 49 .\n\n- If $k \\geq 8$, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 50$ so $n+k \\geq 58$, which is not minimal.\n- If one of the factors is a multiple of 49 , then 49 must be included in the list so $n-2 k+1 \\leq 49$ (giving $n \\leq 48+2 k$ ) and $49 \\leq n-k-1$ (giving $n \\geq 50+k$ ). In this case, we already know that $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ and now we also have $50+k \\leq n \\leq 48+2 k$.\n\nFor these ranges to overlap, we need $50+k \\leq 40+2 k$ and so $k \\geq 10$, which means that $n \\geq 50+k \\geq 60$, and so $n+k \\geq 70$, which is not minimal.\n\n* Next, we consider the case where $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nHere, $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$ (to include 41 in the product) and $n$ is a multiple of 7 .\n\nSince $k$ is at least 2 by definition, then $n \\geq 42+k \\geq 44$, so $n$ is at least 49 .\n\nIf $n$ was 56 or more, we do not get a minimal value for $n+k$.\n\nThus, we need to have $n=49$. In this case, we do not need to look for another factor of 7 in the list.\n\nTo complete this case, we need to find the smallest value of $k$ for which 49 is in the range from $42+k$ to $40+2 k$ because we need to have $42+k \\leq n \\leq 40+2 k$.\n\nThis value of $k$ is $k=5$, which gives $n+k=49+5=54$.\n\nSince $f(49,5)$ is divisible by 2009 , as determined above, then this is the case that minimizes $n+k$, giving a value of 54 .",

    "answer": "$\\frac{5 \\sqrt{39}}{3}$",
    "solution": "First consider a regular octahedron of side length 1. To compute its volume, divide it into two square-based pyramids with edges of length 1 . Such a pyramid has slant height $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$ and height $\\sqrt{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)^{2}-\\left(\\frac{1}{2}\\right)^{2}}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{2}}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}$, so its volume is $\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 1^{2} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{6}$. Thus the octahedron has volume twice that, or $\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}$. The result of folding the net shown is actually the image of a regular octahedron after being stretched along an axis perpendicular to one face by a factor of $r$. Because the octahedron is only being stretched in one dimension, the volume changes by the same factor $r$. So the problem reduces to computing the factor $r$ and the edge length of the resulting octahedron.\n\nFor convenience, imagine that one face of the octahedron rests on a plane. Seen from above the plane, the octahedron appears as shown below.\n\n\n\n<img_3368>\n\nLet $P$ be the projection of $A$ onto the plane on which the octahedron rests, and let $Q$ be the foot of the perpendicular from $P$ to $\\overline{B C}$. Then $P Q=R_{C}-R_{I}$, where $R_{C}$ is the circumradius and $R_{I}$ the inradius of the equilateral triangle. Thus $P Q=\\frac{2}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)-\\frac{1}{3}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)=\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{6}$. Then $B P^{2}=P Q^{2}+B Q^{2}=\\frac{3}{36}+\\frac{1}{4}=\\frac{1}{3}$, so $A P^{2}=A B^{2}-B P^{2}=\\frac{2}{3}$, and $A P=\\frac{\\sqrt{6}}{3}$.\n\nNow let a vertical stretch take place along an axis parallel to $\\overleftrightarrow{A P}$. If the scale factor is $r$, then $A P=\\frac{r \\sqrt{6}}{3}$, and because the stretch occurs on an axis perpendicular to $\\overline{B P}$, the length $B P$ is unchanged, as can be seen below.\n\n<img_3791>\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6 r^{2}}{9}+\\frac{1}{3}=\\frac{6 r^{2}+3}{9}$. It remains to compute $r$. But $r$ is simply the ratio of the new volume to the old volume:\n\n$$\nr=\\frac{6}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{3}}=\\frac{18}{\\sqrt{2}}=9 \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nThus $A B^{2}=\\frac{6(9 \\sqrt{2})^{2}+3}{9}=\\frac{975}{9}=\\frac{325}{3}$, and $A B=\\frac{5 \\sqrt{39}}{3}$.",

Compute the number of possible paths Xena could trace.\n\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "16",
    "solution": "Count the number of complete paths that pass through all vertices exactly once (such a path is called a Hamiltonian path). The set of vertices can be split into two rings:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}=\\left\\{A_{1}, A_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6}\\right\\} \\text { (i.e., the inner ring), } \\quad \\mathcal{O}=\\left\\{B_{1}, B_{2}, \\ldots, B_{6}\\right\\} \\text { (i.e., the outer ring). }\n$$\n\nwhere $A_{1}=A$. The two rings are connected by the edges $E=\\left\\{A_{1} B_{1}, A_{2} B_{2}, \\ldots, A_{6} B_{6}\\right\\}$. Each vertex in the figure has exactly three edges joining it with the neighboring vertices. Also note that any closed loop must use exactly two edges (out of three) for each vertex.\n\nFurther note that a loop must use at least one edge from $E$ to move from one ring to the other. Consider two cases: the loop uses all six edges from $E$, or it uses some but not all of them.\n\nIf all edges from $E$ are used, there are two possible undirected loops. It is not possible to use both edges $A_{1} A_{2}$ and $B_{1} B_{2}$, so either $A_{1} A_{2}$ or $B_{1} B_{2}$ will be used. This choice determines how the entire loop is constructed.\n\nIf not all edges from $E$ are used, then there must be some $i$ for which the loop uses the edge $A_{i} B_{i}$ and does not use $A_{i+1} B_{i+1}$ (where $A_{j} B_{j}$ represents $A_{j-6} B_{j-6}$ if $7 \\leq j \\leq 12$ ). Because $A_{i+1}$ is only connected to three other vertices, the loop must use $A_{i} A_{i+1}$ and $A_{i+1} A_{i+2}$, and similarly must use $B_{i} B_{i+1}$ and $B_{i+1} B_{i+2}$. This also precludes using $A_{i+2} B_{i+2}$, because doing so would close the loop before it visits all 12 vertices. Therefore the loop must also use $A_{i+2} A_{i+3}$ and $B_{i+2} B_{i+3}$, which now precludes using $A_{i+3} B_{i+3}$. This continues to force the structure of the loop until it closes by using $A_{i+5} B_{i+5}=A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use exactly two edges from $E$, and they must be consecutive: $A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose those two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nThe forced path is a loop, and the only way the given conditions are satisfied if $A_{i+k}=A_{i-1}$ and $B_{i+k}=B_{i-1}$. Hence the loop must use (precisely) two consecutive edges from $E: A_{i-1} B_{i-1}$ and $A_{i} B_{i}$. There are 6 ways to choose two consecutive edges, so there are 6 possible undirected loops in this case.\n\nEach undirected loop can be traced in two ways, and thus the number of ways for Xena to trace the path is $(6+2) \\cdot 2=16$.",

    "answer": "12, 8",
    "solution": "or the map $M$ from figure a, $W(M)=7$. The most efficient strategy is to use 7 Cops to blanket all the hideouts on the first day. Any strategy using fewer than 7 Cops would require 6 Cops on each of two consecutive days: given that any hideout can be reached from any other hideout, leaving more than one hideout unsearched on one day makes it is impossible to eliminate any hideouts the following day. So any other strategy would require a minimum of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nFor the map $M$ from figure b, $W(M)=8$. The strategy outlined in $2 \\mathrm{~b}$ used three Cops for a maximum of four workdays, yielding 12 Cop workdays. The most efficient strategy is to use 4 Cops, positioned at $\\{B, E, H, K\\}$ for 2 days each. The following argument demonstrates that 8 Cop workdays is in fact minimal. First, notice that there is no advantage to searching one of the hideouts between vertices of the square (for example, $C$ ) without searching the other hideout between the same vertices (for example, $D$ ). The Robber can reach $C$ on day $n$ if and only if he is at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n-1$, and in either case he could just as well go to $D$ instead of $C$. So there is no situation in which the Robber is certain to be caught at $C$ rather than at $D$. Additionally, the Robber's possible locations on day $n+1$ are the same whether he is at $C$ or $D$ on day $n$, so searching one rather than the other fails to rule out any locations for future days. So any successful strategy that involves searching $C$ should also involve searching $D$ on the same day, and similarly for $F$ and $G, I$ and $J$, and $L$ and $A$. On the other hand, if the Robber must be at one of $C$ and $D$ on day $n$, then he must be at either $B$ or $E$ on day $n+1$, because those are the only adjacent hideouts. So any strategy that involves searching both hideouts of one of the off-the-square pairs on day $n$ is equivalent to a strategy that searches the adjacent on-the-square hideouts on day $n+1$; the two strategies use the same number of Cops for the same number of workdays. Thus the optimal number of Cop workdays can be achieved using strategies that only search the \"corner\" hideouts $B, E, H, K$.\n\nRestricting the search to only those strategies searching corner hideouts $B, E, H, K$, a total of 8 workdays can be achieved by searching all four hideouts on two consecutive days: if the Robber is at one of the other eight hideouts the first day, he must move to one of the two adjacent corner hideouts the second day. But each of these corner hideouts is adjacent to two other corner hideouts. So if only one hideout is searched, for no matter how many consecutive days, the following day, the Robber could either be back at the previously-searched hideout or be at any other hideout: no possibilities are ruled out. If two adjacent corners are searched, the Cops do no better, as the following argument shows. Suppose that $B$ and $E$ are both searched for two consecutive days. Then the Cops can rule out $B, E, C$, and $D$ as possible locations, but if the Cops then switch to searching either $H$ or $K$ instead of $B$ or $E$, the Robber can go back to $C$ or $D$ within two days. So searching two adjacent corner hideouts for two days is fruitless and costs four Cop workdays. Searching diagonally opposite corner hideouts is even less fruitful, because doing so rules out none of the other hideouts as possible Robber locations. Using three Cops each day, it is easy to imagine scenarios in which the Robber evades capture for three days before being caught: for example, if $B, E, H$ are searched for two consecutive days, the Robber goes from $I$ or $J$ to $K$ to $L$. Therefore if three Cops are used, four days are required for a total of 12 Cop workdays.\n\nIf there are more than four Cops, the preceding arguments show that the number of Cops must be even to produce optimal results (because there is no advantage to searching one hideout between vertices of the square without searching the other). Using six Cops with four at corner hideouts yields no improvement, because the following day, the Robber could get to any of the four corner hideouts, requiring at least four Cops the second day, for ten Cop workdays. If two or fewer Cops are at corner hideouts, the situation is even worse, because if the Robber is not caught that day, he has at least nine possible hideouts the following day (depending on whether the unsearched corners are adjacent or diagonally opposite to each other). Using eight Cops (with four at corner vertices) could eliminate one corner vertex as a possible location for the second day (if the non-corner hideouts searched are on adjacent sides of the square), but eight Cop workdays have already been used on the first day. So 8 Cop workdays is minimal.",

    "solution": "The method of mass points leads to the same results as Menelaus's Theorem, but corresponds to the physical intuition that masses on opposite sides of a fulcrum balance if and only if the products of the masses and their distances from the fulcrum are equal (in physics-speak, the net torque is zero). If a mass of weight 1 is placed at vertex $B$ and masses of weight 2 are placed at vertices $A$ and $C$, then $\\triangle A B C$ balances on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{B F}$ and also on the line $\\overleftrightarrow{C E}$. Thus it balances on the point $H$ where these two lines intersect. Replacing the masses at $A$ and $C$ with a single mass of weight 4 at their center of mass $F$, the triangle still balances at $H$. Thus $B H / H F=4$.\n\nNext, consider $\\triangle B E F$. Placing masses of weight 1 at the vertices $B$ and $E$ and a mass of weight 4 at $F$, the triangle balances at $G$. A similar argument shows that $D G / G F=2$ and that $E G / G H=5$. Because $\\triangle D E G$ and $\\triangle F H G$ have congruent (vertical) angles at $G$, it follows that $[D E G] /[F H G]=(D G / F G) \\cdot(E G / H G)=2 \\cdot 5=10$.

For example, in the $p$-signature $(. ., 2143,2431, \\ldots), 2143$ and 2431 are compatible. Notice that the last three digits of 2143 and the first three digits of 2431 can be described by the same 3-label, 132 .\n\nTheorem: A signature $\\sigma$ is possible if and only if every pair of consecutive windows is compatible.\n\nProof: $(\\Rightarrow)$ Consider a signature $\\sigma$ describing a $p$-label $L$. If some pair in $\\sigma$ is not compatible, then there is some string of $p-1$ numbers in our label $L$ that has two different $(p-1)$-signatures. This is impossible, since the $p$-signature is well-defined.\n\n$(\\Leftarrow)$ Now suppose $\\sigma$ is a $p$-signature such that that every pair of consecutive windows is compatible. We need to show that there is at least one label $L$ with $S_{p}[L]=\\sigma$. We do so by induction on the number of windows in $\\sigma$, using the results from $5(\\mathrm{~b})$.\n\nLet $\\sigma=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\omega_{2}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$, and suppose $\\omega_{1}=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{p}$. Set $L_{1}=\\omega_{1}$.\n\nSuppose that $L_{k}$ is a $(p+k-1)$-label such that $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k}\\right\\}$. We will construct $L_{k+1}$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k+1}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$.\n\nAs in $5(\\mathrm{~b})$, denote by $L_{k}^{(j)}$ the label $L_{k}$ with a $j+0.5$ appended; we will eventually renumber the elements in the label to make them all integers. Appending $j+0.5$ does not affect any of the non-terminal windows of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}\\right]$, and as $j$ varies from 0 to $p-k+1$ the final window of $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$ varies over each of the $p$ windows compatible with $\\omega_{k}$. Since $\\omega_{k+1}$ is compatible with $\\omega_{k}$, there exists some $j$ for which $S_{p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]=\\left\\{\\omega_{1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{k+1}\\right\\}$. Now we renumber as follows: set $L_{k+1}=S_{k+p}\\left[L_{k}^{(j)}\\right]$, which replaces $L_{k}^{(j)}$ with the integers 1 through $k+p$ and preserves the relative order of all integers in the label.\n\nBy continuing this process, we conclude that the $n$-label $L_{n-p+1}$ has $p$-signature $\\sigma$, so $\\sigma$ is possible.\n\nTo count the number of possible $p$-signatures, we choose the first window ( $p$ ! choices), then choose each of the remaining $n-p$ compatible windows ( $p$ choices each). In all, there are $p ! \\cdot p^{n-p}$ possible $p$-signatures.",

    "solution": "The answer is $p=16$. To show this fact we will need to extend the idea from part 8(b) about \"linking\" inequalities forced by the various windows:\n\nTheorem: A $p$-signature for an $n$-label $L$ is unique if and only if for every $k<n, k$ and $k+1$ are in at least one window together. That is, the distance between them in the $n$-label is less than $p$.\n\nProof: Suppose that for some $k$, the distance between $k$ and $k+1$ is $p$ or greater. Then the label $L^{\\prime}$ obtained by swapping $k$ and $k+1$ has the same $p$-signature, because there are no numbers between $k$ and $k+1$ in any window and because the two numbers never appear in the same window.\n\nIf the distance between all such pairs is less than $k$, we need to show that $S_{p}[L]$ is unique. For $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$, let $r_{i}$ denote the position where $i$ appears in $L$. For example, if $L=4123$, then $r_{1}=2, r_{2}=3, r_{3}=4$, and $r_{4}=1$.\n\nLet $L=a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$. Since 1 and 2 are in some window together, $a_{r_{1}}<a_{r_{2}}$. Similarly, for any $k$, since $k$ and $k+1$ are in some window together, $a_{r_{k}}<a_{r_{k+1}}$.

Therefore, $S_{p}[L]$ is unique.\n\nFrom the proof above, we know that the signature is unique if and only if every pair of consecutive integers coexists in at least one window.

If reflections, rotations, etc. of placements are considered distinct, compute the number of distinct okay placements.\n\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "32",
    "solution": "We say that two numbers are neighbors if they occupy adjacent squares, and that $a$ is a friend of $b$ if $0<|a-b| \\leq 2$. Using this vocabulary, the problem's condition is that every pair of neighbors must be friends of each other. Each of the numbers 1 and 8 has two friends, and each number has at most four friends.\n\nIf there is no number written in the center square, then we must have one of the cycles in the figures below. For each cycle, there are 8 rotations. Thus there are 16 possible configurations with no number written in the center square.\n\n| 2 | 1 | 3 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 4 | - | 5 |\n| 6 | 8 | 7 |\n\n\n| 3 | 1 | 2 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 5 | - | 4 |\n| 7 | 8 | 6 |\n\nNow assume that the center square contains the number $n$. Because $n$ has at least three neighbors, $n \\neq 1$ and $n \\neq 8$. First we show that 1 must be in a corner. If 1 is a neighbor of $n$, then one of the corners neighboring 1 must be empty, because 1 has only two friends ( 2 and $3)$. If $c$ is in the other corner neighboring 1 , then $\\{n, c\\}=\\{2,3\\}$. But then $n$ must have three\n\n\n\nmore friends $\\left(n_{1}, n_{2}, n_{3}\\right)$ other than 1 and $c$, for a total of five friends, which is impossible, as illustrated below. Therefore 1 must be in a corner.\n\n| - | 1 | $c$ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $n_{1}$ | $n$ | $n_{2}$ |\n|  | $n_{3}$ |  |\n\nNow we show that 1 can only have one neighbor, i.e., one of the squares adjacent to 1 is empty. If 1 has two neighbors, then we have, up to a reflection and a rotation, the configuration shown below. Because 2 has only one more friend, the corner next to 2 is empty and $n=4$. Consequently, $m_{1}=5$ (refer to the figure below). Then 4 has one friend (namely 6) left with two neighbors $m_{2}$ and $m_{3}$, which is impossible. Thus 1 must have exactly one neighbor. An analogous argument shows that 8 must also be at a corner with exactly one neighbor.\n\n| 1 | 2 | - |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| 3 | $n$ | $m_{3}$ |\n| $m_{1}$ | $m_{2}$ |  |\n\nTherefore, 8 and 1 must be in non-opposite corners, with the blank square between them. Thus, up to reflections and rotations, the only possible configuration is the one shown at left below.\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| $m$ |  |  |\n|  |  |  |\n\n\n| 1 | - | 8 |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $2 / 3$ | $4 / 5$ | $6 / 7$ |\n| $3 / 2$ | $5 / 4$ | $7 / 6$ |\n\nThere are two possible values for $m$, namely 2 and 3 . For each of the cases $m=2$ and $m=3$, the rest of the configuration is uniquely determined, as illustrated in the figure above right. We summarize our process: there are four corner positions for 1; two (non-opposite) corner positions for 8 (after 1 is placed); and two choices for the number in the square neighboring 1 but not neighboring 8 . This leads to $4 \\cdot 2 \\cdot 2=16$ distinct configurations with a number written in the center square.\n\nTherefore, there are 16 configurations in which the center square is blank and 16 configurations with a number in the center square, for a total of $\\mathbf{3 2}$ distinct configurations.",

    "answer": "21",
    "solution": "Let us consider $N=1$ equilateral triangles. From inspection, we need to place the triangle such that the center of mass lies at the edge of the table. The maximum overhang in this case is $(1-f) h$ where $h=\\frac{\\ell \\sqrt{3}}{2}$ is the height of the triangle and $f h=\\frac{h}{3}$ is the location of the center of mass.\nIf we wish to place a second triangle on top, we want to maximize the center of mass to be as far right as possible without the top block toppling. Placing the second block such that its center of mass is at the tip of the first triangle accomplishes this. However, the center of mass of the two triangles combined is now past the edge. Their center of mass is:\n\n$$\nx_{\\mathrm{cm}}=\\frac{f h+h}{2}=\\frac{f+1}{2} h\n$$\n\nThus the maximum overhang of the first block is now:\n\n$$\nh-\\frac{f+1}{2} h=\\frac{1-f}{2} h\n$$\n\nNow, we will place a third block such that it has the maximum overhang with respect to the top block and then shift the entire setup so that the center of mass of the system lies at the edge of the table. Following the same procedures, we find that the maximum overhang of the first block is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1-f}{3} h\n$$\n\nThe overhang of the top two blocks are $(1-f) h$ and $\\frac{1-f}{2} h$, unchanged from earlier.

The ride takes place entirely in a two dimensional plane.\n\nSome students made a remark that at one time, the acceleration was perpendicular to the velocity. Using this graph, what is the minimum x-velocity the ride could be travelling at for this to be true? Round to the nearest integer and answer in meters per second. The diagram is drawn to scale, and you may print this page out and make measurements.\n\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "1",
    "solution": "The solution revolves around the idea that when the acceleration is perpendicular to the velocity, the work done is 0 , and thus, the instantaneous rate of change of the magnitude of velocity $v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}$ is 0 . Thus, at such points, when the vertical velocity is plotted against the horizontal velocity, the curve will be tangent to a circle centered at the origin because $v_{y}^{2}+v_{x}^{2}$ is nonchanging at that instant.\nThis is equivalent to stating that the line from the origin to the curve is perpendicular to the curve. Drawing such lines to the curve, the first time this occurs is at $v_{x}=1 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$.",

    "answer": "40",
    "solution": "Our first goal is to find an expression for the power curve $P(v)$. To do this, let us select a few points on the curve. The easiest point to pick is $(0,0)$ since it is fixed at the origin. The next two easiest points to pick are those that are on the lines $x=3$ and $x=6$ which are given as approximately $(3,1.8)$ and $(6,7.2)$. Note that $y$-axis is in units of $100 \\mathrm{~W}$ so in reality these two points are given as $(3,180)$ and $(6,720)$. This curve is resemblant of a quadratic in the form of $y=k_{1} x^{2}$ and upon solving for $k_{1}$ we find that the curve is given as $P=20 v^{2}$. Secondly, the next line remains constant with respect to time as a line $P=900$. Therefore, we can write a piecewise function for power defined by\n$$\nP(v)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n20 v^{2} & \\text { if } v \\geq 0, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad v<6 \\\\\n900 & \\text { if } v \\geq 6\n\\end{array} .\\right.\n$$\n\n\n\nWe need to find the relationship between power, velocity, and displacement of Mario. Consider dividing the displacement into tiny rectangular pieces with width $\\Delta t$ such that\n\n$$\ns=\\sum_{i \\in \\mathbb{N}} \\Delta s_{i}=\\sum_{i} v_{i}(t) \\cdot \\Delta t\n$$\n\nWe want to the displacement to be expressed in terms without $\\Delta t$.

    "answer": "39",
    "solution": "Define point $O$ as the point in the plane that the axis of rotation passes through. Since moments of inertia simply add about a given axis, we can calculate the moments of inertia of the three \"sectors\" whose union forms the given area and subtract twice the moment of inertia of the triangle, so our answer will be $3 I_{s, O}-2 I_{t, O}$.\nClaim: The center of mass of a sector is $\\frac{2}{\\pi}$ away from the vertex of the sector along its axis of symmetry. Proof: We can divide the sector into arbitrarily small sectors that can be approximated as isosceles triangles. It's well known that the center of mass of one such isosceles triangle is $\\frac{2}{3}$ of the way from the central vertex to the base. Therefore, the center of mass of the sector is the center of mass of the arc with central angle $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ and same center with radius $\\frac{2}{3}$ contained within the sector. Since the center of mass has to lie on the axis of symmetry, we set that as the $\\mathrm{x}$ axis with the vertex of the sector being $x=0$. Then, the $x$-coordinate of a point on the arc whose corresponding radius makes an angle of $\\theta$ with the axis of symmetry is $\\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta)$. We can integrate this over all possible angles $\\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6} \\leq \\theta \\leq \\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)$ and then divide by the range $\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{3}\\right)$ to get the average $x$-coordinate, or the center of mass.\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\frac{2}{3} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta}{\\frac{\\pi}{3}} \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi} \\int_{-\\frac{\\pi}{6}}^{\\frac{\\pi}{6}} \\cos (\\theta) \\mathrm{d} \\theta \\\\\n\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\left(\\sin \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)-\\sin \\left(-\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\n\n\nThis concludes the proof.\n\nNow define point $X$ as the vertex of a sector and point $M$ as the center of mass of that sector. According to the parallel axis theorem,\n\n$$\nI_{s, X}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}\\right)^{2}\n$$\n\n. It's well known that $I_{s, X}=\\frac{1}{2} m_{s} r^{2}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}$, and so\n\n$$\nI_{s, M}=\\frac{m_{s}}{2}-\\frac{4 m_{s}}{\\pi^{2}}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{\\pi^{2}-8}{2 \\pi^{2}}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's also well known that $O$ is on the line of symmetry and a distance of $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$ away from $X$, and so $M X=$ $\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\nI_{s, O}=I_{s, M}+m_{s}\\left(\\frac{2}{\\pi}-\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)^{2}=m_{s}\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)\n$$\n\nIt's well known that, since $O$ is the center of mass of the triangle,\n\n$$\nI_{t, O}=\\frac{1}{12}\n$$\n\nNow we just need to calculate $m_{s}$. Since the mass of the triangle is $1 \\mathrm{~kg}$, this is equivalent to finding the ratio of the area of a sector to the area of a triangle. Through geometry, this is found to be $\\frac{2 \\pi}{3 \\sqrt{3}}$. Finally, we get our answer to be\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{2 \\pi}{\\sqrt{3}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{5 \\pi-8 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\pi}\\right)-\\frac{1}{6}=\\left(\\frac{10 \\pi-17 \\sqrt{3}}{6 \\sqrt{3}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $a+b+c+d+e=10+17+3+6+3=039$",

    "solution": "The capacitance is proportional to $C \\propto \\frac{1}{d}$, where $d$ is the distance between successive parallel plates.

The radius of the spaceship is $R$. For this problem, we will only consider motion in the plane perpendicular to the axis of the spaceship. Let point $O$ be the center of the spaceship. Initially, an ideal zero-length spring has one end fixed at point $O$, while the other end is connected to a mass $m$ at the \"ground\" of the spaceship, where the astronauts are standing (we will call this point $A$ ). From the astronauts' point of view, the mass remains motionless.\n\nNext, Alice fixes one end of the spring at point $A$, and attaches the mass to the other end at point $O$. Bob starts at point $A$, and moves an angle $\\theta$ counterclockwise to point $B$ (such that $A O B$ is an isosceles triangle). At time $t=0$, the mass at point $O$ is released. Given that the mass comes close enough for Bob to catch it, find the value of $\\theta$ to the nearest tenth of a degree.\n\nAssume that the only force acting on the mass is the spring's tension, and that the astronauts' heights are much less than $R$.\n\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "$60.2$",
    "solution": "First, we must have $\\omega^{2} R=g$ and $k=m \\omega^{2}$. Now, we step into the frame of point $A$, rotating around with the spaceship. We will thus have three fictitious forces: translational, centrifugal, and coriolis. Note that because centrifugal is $m \\omega^{2} r$, pointing away from $A$, it cancels with the spring force. Thus, the only forces left to consider are translational and coriolis.\nThe translational force points \"down\" with a constant magnitude of $m g$, like gravity. The coriolis force\n\n\n\npoints perpendicular to the velocity with magnitude $2 m \\omega v$. We recognize this setup is analogous to that of a charged particle moving in an E field and B field. It is well known that the mass will follow a cycloid shape. Writing the equation of the cycloid, and finding where the cycloid hits the circle (spaceship), we can find $\\theta$. Note that we have to use numerical methods.\n\nSpecifically, the cycloid can be parametrized as $\\frac{R}{4}(\\alpha-\\sin \\alpha, 1-\\cos \\alpha)$, and we need to find where this intersects the circle $x^{2}+y^{2}=R^{2}$, so $(\\alpha-\\sin \\alpha)^{2}+(1-\\cos \\alpha)^{2}=16$. Solving gives $\\alpha=3.307$, and since $\\cot \\theta=\\frac{1-\\cos \\alpha}{\\alpha-\\sin \\alpha}$, we have $\\theta=60.2^{\\circ}$.",

    "answer": "0.568",
    "solution": "After the collision, let the wheel have speed $v_{1}$ and the ball have speed $v_{2}$.

At each joint, we can write out force equilibrium equations in the vertical and horizontal directions, and solve a system of linaer equations to get the force in $C D$.\nInstead, we can solve for this force in one line. Consider a horizontal slice right above point $D$.\n\n\n\n<img_4293>\n\nSince the net force of this sub-element is still zero, we can do a force balance. The only external forces acting on this system is $E F, E C, C D$, and the $5 \\mathrm{kN}$ weight. If we do a torque balance about $E$, we get:\n\n$$\n5(2 L)=C D(L)\n\\tag{5}\n$$\n\nwhere $L$ is the length of the rod. This immediately gives $C D=10 \\mathrm{kN}$.",

    "solution": "Create a free body diagram. The direction of the magnetic field (into or out of the page) does not matter as we only need to know the magnitude of the terminal velocity.

    "answer": "2.5",
    "solution": "Method One: Let us look at only the major axis $x$. The wind provides a constant acceleration along $x$, which makes this problem equivalent to throwing a ball up and down a ramp tilted at an angle of $\\beta=\\tan \\frac{a}{g}$.

Its setup consists of a steel ball, represented by a point mass, of negligible radius and a frictionless vertical track. The goal of Pico-Pico is to flick the ball from the beginning of the track (point $A$ ) such that it is able to traverse through the track while never leaving the track, successfully reaching the end (point $B)$. The most famous track design is one of parabolic shape; specifically, the giant track is of the shape $h(x)=5-2 x^{2}$ in meters. The starting and ending points of the tracks are where the two points where the track intersects $y=0$. If $\\left(v_{a}, v_{b}\\right]$ is the range of the ball's initial velocity $v_{0}$ that satisfies the winning condition of Pico-Pico, help Poncho find $v_{b}-v_{a}$.

    "answer": "7.19",
    "solution": "For this part, we regard the basketball as a point mass. Now to account for the backboard bounce, we reflect the hoop over the backboard.

One way to do it is to use the safety parabola, which makes it so minimal calculations are needed, so we present that method here. However, this problem is also readily solvable with only basic kinematics.\nThe point that the ball must hit (4.15 meters in front and 1 meter above) lies on the safety parabola when it is thrown at minimum speed.

So the minimum velocity to go this height is given by\n\n$$\n\\frac{v^{2}}{2 g}=2.63 \\mathrm{~m}\n$$\n\nand that gives $v=7.19 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$. There is one last bit we need to check to complete this problem. The basketball's trajectory has to actually be possible (i.e. it doesn't go underneath the rim). It is clearly less optimal intuitively. If it passes through the underside, it means that its apex of the trajectory is very near its target.",

    "answer": "2.061",
    "solution": "Due to the length of toilet paper hanging off, the toilet paper will be slightly tilted, in order for torques to balance.

    "answer": "0.65",
    "solution": "We use the method of phasors.

As it falls down, the minimum tension acting on the thread over the rod's entire motion is given by $\\alpha m g$. Determine $\\alpha$.\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "0.165",
    "solution": "First note that the thread is given to be very long. Therefore, only vertical tension and gravitational forces act on the rod allowing for its center of mass to move in a straight vertical line. Using this fact, we can now write the acceleration of the rod in terms of angular velocity $\\omega$ and angular acceleration $\\varepsilon$. Let the angle of the rod at any moment to the vertical be $\\varphi$. For simplicity, we define the length of the rod to be $2 l$. Then, by defining the coordinate $y$ to be the change in vertical length of the rod where $y=l \\cos \\varphi$, one can write for varying $\\varphi \\in[\\varphi, \\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)$ that $l \\cos (\\varphi+\\mathrm{d} \\varphi)=y+\\mathrm{d} y \\Longrightarrow \\mathrm{d} y=l \\sin \\varphi \\mathrm{d} \\varphi$. Thus, simple differentiation proves that\n$$\nv=l \\sin \\varphi \\omega \\Longrightarrow a=l \\varepsilon \\sin \\varphi+l \\omega^{2} \\cos \\varphi\n$$\n\nWe can now also write conservation of energy to get another relationship between velocity and angular velocity. At any given moment, it can be written that $m g l=\\frac{1}{2} m v^{2}+\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega^{2}-m g l \\cos \\varphi$. Since $I=\\frac{1}{2} m(2 l)^{2}=\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2}$, then\n\n$$\nm g l(1+\\cos \\varphi)=m l^{2} \\omega^{2}\\left(\\frac{1}{2} \\sin ^{2} \\varphi+\\frac{1}{6}\\right)\n$$\n\nOur third equation comes from the fact that the tension on the rod at any moment can be written as $T=m g-m a \\Longrightarrow m a=m g-T$. We can finally get a fourth equation by equating torques such that $\\frac{1}{3} m l^{2} \\varepsilon=T l \\sin \\varphi$. With these four equations, simple algebra yields the tension at any point is\n\n$$\nT(\\varphi)=\\frac{1+(3 \\cos \\varphi-1)^{2}}{\\left(1+3 \\sin ^{2} \\varphi\\right)^{2}} m g \\Longrightarrow T_{\\min } \\approx 0.165 m g\n$$",

Note that the setup is horizontal so gravity does not need to be accounted for.\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "25273",
    "solution": "After the first collision, the charge approaches a constant magnitude. Let's look at a collision with the plate at charge $q$ hitting the $-\\sigma$ plate. Since the slab is thin, to keep the conducting surface an equipotential, the charge on the conduting slab has to become $-\\sigma s^{2}$. The initial charge doesn't matter because the plates are infinite. So the charge is $-\\sigma s^{2}$ after leaving the negative plate and $+\\sigma s^{2}$ after leaving the positive plate.\nNow the acceleration always has a constant magnitude, which is directed toward the plate it is traveling to, which we can find using $F=m a$,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\sigma s^{2}\\right) \\frac{\\sigma}{\\epsilon_{0}}=m a \\Longrightarrow a=\\frac{\\sigma^{2} s^{2}}{\\epsilon_{0} m}=7.06 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}^{2}\n$$\n\n\n\nThen here we can use the trick of reflecting over the plates, and now it's a basic kinematics problem.

Note that the diagram presents a side view of the chamber (i.e. gravity is oriented downwards with respect to the diagram).\n<image_1>\n\nAssume the following about the setup and the ideal fluid:\n\n- fluid flow is steady in the frame of the center of mass of the cylinder\n- the ideal fluid is incompressible, irrotational, and has zero viscosity\n- the angular velocity of the cylinder is approximately constant during its subsequent motion\n\nHint: For a uniform cylinder of radius $R$ rotating counterclockwise at angular velocity $\\omega$ situated in an ideal fluid with flow velocity $u$ to the right far away from the cylinder, the velocity potential $\\Phi$ is given by\n\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta)=u r \\cos \\theta+u \\frac{R^{2}}{r} \\cos \\theta+\\frac{\\Gamma \\theta}{2 \\pi}\n$$\n\nwhere $(r, \\theta)$ is the polar coordinate system with origin at the center of the cylinder. $\\Gamma$ is the circulation and is equal to $2 \\pi R^{2} \\omega$. The fluid velocity is given by\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}=\\nabla \\Phi=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta} \\hat{\\theta}\n$$",
    "answer": "$1.25$",
    "solution": "We will work in the reference frame of the center of mass of the cylinder because the fluid flow is steady in this reference frame. The key intuition here is that the magnitude of the fluid velocity above the cylinder will be higher on the top because the tangential velocity of the cylinder is in the same direction as the velocity of the fluid on the top. By Bernoulli's principle, this means that the pressure on the top is lower than the pressure on the bottom, which will create a lift force on the cylinder.\nWith the given theory, we can model this quantitatively. In our chosen reference frame, the water\n\n\n\nmoves with velocity $v$ to the left. The velocity potential around a cylinder with radius $R$ is\n\n$$\n\\Phi(r, \\theta)=-v r \\cos \\theta-v \\frac{R^{2}}{r} \\cos \\theta+R^{2} \\omega \\theta\n$$\n\nTherefore, we find\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{v}=\\nabla \\Phi=\\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial r} \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}+\\frac{1}{r} \\frac{\\partial \\Phi}{\\partial \\theta} \\hat{\\theta}=-v\\left(1-\\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}\\right) \\cos \\theta \\hat{\\mathbf{r}}+\\left(v\\left(1+\\frac{R^{2}}{r^{2}}\\right) \\sin \\theta+R \\omega\\right) \\hat{\\theta}\n$$\n\nAs expected from boundary conditions, the radial velocity vanishes when $r=R$. Furthermore, on the surface of the cylinder, we have the tangential velocity of the fluid is $2 v \\sin \\theta+R \\omega$ in the counterclockwise direction. Consider points on the cylinder at angles $\\theta$ and $-\\theta$. By Bernoulli's principle (ignoring the height difference which will be accounted with the buoyant force),\n\n$$\np_{-\\theta}-p_{\\theta}=\\frac{1}{2} \\rho\\left((2 v \\sin \\theta+R \\omega)^{2}-(-2 v \\sin \\theta+R \\omega)^{2}\\right)=4 \\rho v R \\omega \\sin \\theta\n$$\n\nIf we integrate this result along the surface of the cylinder, we can find the lift force per unit length. Note that only the vertical components of the pressure will matter as the horizontal components cancel due to symmetry. The vertical component of the pressure difference is then $4 \\rho v r_{0} \\omega \\sin ^{2} \\theta$. Thus, the lift force per unit length is\n\n$$\n\\frac{F_{\\text {lift }}}{H}=\\int_{0}^{\\pi} 4 \\rho v R \\omega \\sin ^{2}(\\theta)(R d \\theta)=2 \\pi \\rho \\omega v R^{2}\n$$\n\nThe total left force is\n\n$$\nF_{\\text {lift }}=2 \\pi \\rho R^{2} H \\omega v \\text {. }\n$$\n\nThe gravitational force is $M g$, and the buoyant force is $\\pi R^{2} H \\rho g$. Therefore, we must have\n\n$$\n\\pi R^{2} H \\rho g+2 \\pi \\rho R^{2} H \\omega v=M g\n$$\n\nSolving for $\\omega$, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\omega=\\frac{M g}{2 \\pi R^{2} H \\rho v}-\\frac{g}{2 v}\n$$\n\n$1.25 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$",

This superconducting rectangular loop initially has a current $I_{1}=5 \\mathrm{~A}$ in the counterclockwise direction as shown in the figure below. This rectangular loop is situated a distance $d=1 \\mathrm{~cm}$ above an infinitely long wire that initially contains no current. Suppose that the current in the infinitely long wire is increased to some current $I_{2}$ such that there is an attractive force $F$ between the rectangular loop and the long wire. Find the maximum possible value of $F$. Write your answer in newtons.\nHint: You may neglect the magnetic field produced by the vertical segments in the rectangular loop.\n\n<image_1>",
    "answer": "$1.12 \\times 10^{-3}$",
    "solution": "The key idea is that the superconducting loop must have constant flux. If it did not, by Faraday's Law, an emf\n$$\n\\mathcal{E}=-\\frac{d \\Phi}{d t}\n$$\n\nwould be generated in the loop. Since superconducting materials have no resistance, this would imply an infinite current, hence a contradiction.\n\nWe will first compute the flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$. Since $w \\ll \\ell$, we can assume that the vertical segments produce negligible amounts of magnetic field. We can furthermore approximate the field produced by one of the horizontal wires a distance $r$ away as\n\n\n\n$\\frac{\\mu_{0} I}{2 \\pi r}$ (this is valid for an infinitely long wire, and therefore is also valid in the regime where $w \\ll \\ell$ ).\n\nThus, the total flux through the rectangular loop when there is a current $I_{1}$ is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{1}=\\int_{r}^{w} B\\left(\\ell d r^{\\prime}\\right)=\\int_{r}^{w-r}\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\pi r^{\\prime}}+\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{1}}{2 \\pi\\left(w-r^{\\prime}\\right)}\\right) \\ell d r^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{1} \\ell}{\\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that the self inductance of the loop is $L=\\frac{\\Phi}{I_{1}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell}{\\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)$.\n\nNow, we will determine the flux through the rectangular loop due to the long current-carrying wire. This is\n\n$$\n\\Phi_{2}=\\int_{d}^{d+w} \\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\pi r}(\\ell d r)=\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2} \\ell}{2 \\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{d+w}{d}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe mutual inductance is $M=\\frac{\\Phi_{2}}{I_{2}}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell}{2 \\pi} \\ln \\left(\\frac{d+w}{d}\\right)$.

The forces on the vertical sides cancel out because the current in the loop is in opposite directions on these sides. From the horizontal sides, we have the force is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF=\\sum\\left(I_{3} \\vec{\\ell} \\times \\vec{B}\\right) & =I_{3} \\ell\\left(\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\pi d}-\\frac{\\mu_{0} I_{2}}{2 \\pi(d+w)}\\right) \\\\\n& =\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell w}{2 \\pi d(d+w)}\\left[I_{2}\\left(I_{1}-\\frac{M}{L} I_{2}\\right)\\right] .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThis quadratic in $I_{2}$ is maximized when $I_{2}=\\frac{L}{2 M} I_{1}$ in which case the force becomes\n\n$$\nF=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell w}{2 \\pi d(d+w)} \\frac{L I_{1}^{2}}{4 M}=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\ell w I_{1}^{2}}{4 \\pi d(d+w)} \\frac{\\ln \\left(\\frac{w}{r}\\right)}{\\ln \\left(\\frac{d+w}{d}\\right)}\n$$\n\nNote: If the size of the wires is considered when computing flux, a slightly different answer is obtained.

(Of course, the polarity of the diode is aligned with that of the power source.) You close the switch, and after some time, the voltage across the capacitor becomes constant.

    "answer": "$2.446 \\times 10^{-3}$",
    "solution": "When current is flowing clockwise, the circuit is equivalent to an LC circuit with a power source $\\mathcal{E}-V_{0}$. Thus, the voltage $U$ is sinusoidal about its equilibrium voltage $U_{0}=\\mathcal{E}-V_{0}$ with frequency $\\omega=1 / \\sqrt{L C}$.\n\nWhen the switch is closed, $I=0$ and $U=U_{\\min }=0$. Afterwards, $I$ increases to $I_{\\max }$ and decreases back to 0 , completing half a period of a sine wave. However, $I$ can not go negative due to the presence of the diode. Instead, a reverse voltage builds up on the diode (so that the voltage across the inductor becomes 0 ), and $I$ stays at 0 . At this point, $U$ becomes constant as well.\n\nThe time it took until the system became static was half a period of the LC circuit oscillation, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{\\omega}=\\pi \\sqrt{L C}=2.446 \\times 10^{-3} \\mathrm{~s}\n$$",

Then, we can say that\n\n$$\nk=\\frac{\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_{n}^{2}}{\\frac{1}{2} I \\omega_{n-1}^{2}} \\Longrightarrow \\omega_{n}=\\sqrt{k} \\omega_{n-1}\n$$\n\nBy recurrence, $\\omega_{n}=k^{n / 2} \\omega_{0}$.

It is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Re}=\\frac{\\rho v L}{\\mu}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\rho$ is the density of the surrounding fluid, $\\mu$ is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, and $L$ is a reference length parameter that varies based on each object. For a smooth ${ }^{1}$ sphere traveling in a fluid, its diameter serves as the reference length parameter.\n\n<image_1>\n\nA logarithmic graph of $C_{D}$ vs Re of a sphere from the NASA Glenn Research Center.\n\nThe relationship between the drag coefficient and the Reynold's number holds significant importance. Due to the complexity of fluid dynamics, empirical data is commonly used, as depicted in the figure provided above. Notably, the figure indicates a significant decrease in the drag coefficient around $\\operatorname{Re} \\approx 4 \\times 10^{5}$. This phenomenon, known as the drag crisis, occurs when a sphere transitions from laminar to turbulent flow, resulting in a broad wake and high drag.\n\nLet's consider a smooth ball with a radius of $0.2 \\mathrm{~m}$ and a mass of $0.1 \\mathrm{~kg}$ dropped in air with a constant density of $\\rho=1.255 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{m}^{3}$. It is found that at velocity $5 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, the Reynold's number of the ball is $3.41 \\cdot 10^{5}$. If the ball is dropped from rest, it approaches a stable terminal velocity $v_{1}$. If the ball is thrown downwards with enough velocity, it will experience turbulence, and approach a stable terminal velocity $v_{2}$. Find $\\Delta v=v_{2}-v_{1}$. Ignore any terminal velocities found for Reynold numbers less than an order of magnitude $10^{-1}$.\n\nNote: This problem is highly idealized as it assumes the atmosphere has air of constant density and temperature.

    "answer": "25.2",
    "solution": "We analyze the thin $\\mathrm{dz}$ of copper which center is at distance $\\mathrm{z}$ away from the magnet. Notice that\n\n\n\nthe thickness of the copper tube $(w=0.5 \\mathrm{~mm})$ is much smaller than its radius. Thus, we may model the copper tube as an infinitesimally thin current loop of radius $a_{0}=a+(w / 2)$ (note that $\\frac{w}{2 a}$ is significant!) with resistance $\\rho \\frac{2 \\pi a_{0}}{w d z}$ where $a=7 \\mathrm{~mm}$. Using the formula for the magnetic field due to the dipole moment, it can be found that the B-field along the current loop is:\n$$\nB=\\frac{\\mu_{0} \\mu}{4 \\pi} \\frac{\\left(2 z^{2}-r^{2}\\right) \\hat{z}+3 r z \\hat{r}}{\\left(r^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5 / 2}}\n$$\nwhere $\\hat{z}$ is the unit vector parallel to the direction of motion of the magnet and $\\hat{r}$ is the unit vector pointing radially outward from the center of the current loop. The flux through the loop is then:\n$$\n\\Phi_{B}=\\int_{0}^{a_{0}} B_{z}(2 \\pi r) d r=\\frac{1}{2} \\mu_{0} \\mu \\frac{a_{0}^{2}}{\\left(z^{2}+a_{0}^{2}\\right)^{3 / 2}}\n$$\nin which Lenz law can be used to get the current of the loop, using the fact $v=-\\frac{d z}{d t}$, where $v$ is the relative velocity of the right cart to the left.\n$$\nI=-\\frac{d \\Phi_{B}}{d t}\\left(\\rho \\frac{2 \\pi a_{0}}{w d z}\\right)^{-1}=\\frac{3 \\mu_{0} \\mu}{4 \\pi} \\frac{a_{0} w v z d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5 / 2}}\n$$\nThe lorentz force on the current loop due to the magnet then obeys:\n$$\nF=I\\left(2 \\pi a_{0}\\right) B_{r} \\hat{z}=\\frac{9}{8 \\pi} \\mu_{0}^{2} \\mu^{2} \\frac{a_{0}^{3} w v z^{2} d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5}} \\hat{z}\n$$\nwhich is repulsive as expected. By Newton's third law, the force on the magnet due to the current in the copper tube is:\n$$\nF=-\\frac{9}{8 \\pi \\rho} \\mu_{0}^{2} \\mu^{2} a_{0}^{3} w v \\int_{-x}^{L-x} \\frac{z^{2} d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5}} \\hat{z}\n$$\nwhere $x$ is the depth of the magnet into the copper tube. However, when $x, L-x>>a_{0}$,\n$$\n\\int_{-x}^{L-x} \\frac{z^{2} d z}{\\rho\\left(a_{0}^{2}+z^{2}\\right)^{5}} \\hat{z} \\approx \\frac{a_{0}^{3}}{a_{0}^{10}} \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{2} d u}{\\left(1+u^{2}\\right)^{5}}=\\frac{5 \\pi}{128 a_{0}^{7}}\n$$\nTherefore, for as long as the magnet is sufficiently within the tube, the force is instead:\n$$\nF=-\\frac{45}{1024 \\rho a_{0}^{4}} \\mu_{0}^{2} \\mu^{2} w v \\hat{z}=-\\gamma v \\hat{z}\n$$\nwhere $\\gamma=0.1815 \\mathrm{~kg} / \\mathrm{s}$.\n\nThe velocity of the second cart starts moving when $F>\\mu_{s} M g$ with $\\mu_{s}=0.01$ and $M=0.3 \\mathrm{~kg}$. It turns out that $\\frac{0.01 \\mathrm{Mg}}{\\gamma v_{0}} \\approx 0.5$, so this static friction is overcome very quickly. Once both carts are in motion, and since there is no kinetic friction, momentum is in fact conserved! As we'll see soon, this results in the carts performing an (infinitely-long) perfectly inelastic collision. In addition, it allows us to use a reduced mass of $M_{\\text {red }}=M / 2$ to calculate the closest distance achieved between the two carts. While $x>>a$ is obeyed:\n$$\n-\\gamma v_{r e l}=\\frac{1}{2} M \\frac{d v_{r e l}}{d t}\n$$\ngiving:\n$$\nv_{r e l}=v_{0} e^{-\\frac{2 \\gamma}{M} t}\n$$\n\nin which $v_{r e l}$ goes to 0 as $t$ goes to $\\infty$, resulting in a perfectly inelastic collision.

In this mechanism, an active particle continuously climbs up the field-gradient generated by its own influence on the environment so that the particle can bootstrap itself into a constant non-zero velocity motion. Consider a field-drive in one-dimensional (the $\\mathrm{O} x$ axis) environment, where the position of the particle at time $t$ is given by $X(t)$ and its instantaneous velocity follows from:\n$$\n\\frac{\\mathrm{d}}{\\mathrm{d} t} X(t)=\\left.\\kappa \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x} R(x, t)\\right|_{x=X(t)}\n$$\nin which $\\kappa$ is called the guiding coefficient and $R(x, t)$ is the field-value in this space. Note that, the operation ... $\\left.\\right|_{x=X(t)}$ means you have to calculate the part in ... first, then replace $x$ with $X(t)$. For a biological example, the active particle can be a cell, the field can be the nutrient concentration, and the strategy of climbing up the gradient can be chemotaxis. The cell consumes the nutrient and also responses to the local nutrient concentration, biasing its movement toward the direction where the concentration increases the most. If the nutrient is not diffusive and always recovers locally (e.g. a surface secretion) to the value which we defined to be 0 , then its dynamics can usually be approximated by:\n$$\n\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} R(x, t)=-\\frac{1}{\\tau} R(x, t)-\\gamma \\exp \\left\\{-\\frac{[x-X(t)]^{2}}{2 \\lambda^{2}}\\right\\}\n$$\nwhere $\\tau$ is the timescale of recovery, $\\gamma$ is the consumption, and $\\lambda$ is the characteristic radius of influence. Before we inoculate the cell into the environment, $R=0$ everywhere at any time. What is the smallest guiding coefficient $\\kappa$ (in $\\mu \\mathrm{m}^{2} / \\mathrm{s}$ ) for field-drive to emerge, if the parameters are $\\tau=50 \\mathrm{~s}, \\gamma=1 \\mathrm{~s}^{-1}$, and $\\lambda=10 \\mu \\mathrm{m}$.\n\n\n\n<image_1>",

(An estimate, ignoring numerical factors, is acceptable.) What about launching space probes to other planets or out of the solar system? Can you guess why most rockets are multistage?",
    "answer": "$\\sqrt{g R}$ , $\\sqrt{2 g R}$",
    "solution": "There are multiple ways of thinking about this problem.\n\n- (Easiest possible answer) To launch the rocket from earth we need at least the force from repulsion to be stronger than the gravity. That is $a=\\mu u / m_{0}>g$. (We get rid of numerical factors on the total mass.)\n\n\n\n- A nicer perspective: The rocket needs to get to gain enough mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential energy) from the repulsion process. It is known (from multiple ways) that the energy of an object with mass $m_{0}$ orbiting a planet in a orbit whose length of the semimajor axis is $a$ is $-G M m_{0} / 2 a=-g R^{2} m_{0} / 2 a$, where $R$ is the radius of the planet ( $G M$ the standard gravitational parameter). Therefore, the minimum energy is at $a=R$ ( $a$ cannot be lower), which is $-g R m_{0} / 2$. Besides that, we know that before launching, when the rocket is on the ground, its potential energy (kinetic energy being zero) is $-G M m_{0} / R=-g R m_{0}$.\n\nTherefore, the minimum mechanical energy needed is $g R m_{0} / 2$. This situation corresponds to \"launching\" the rocket horizontally. The rocket does not go high into the sky but flies right above the ground. As a result, as a not so bad approximation, the launching process is not affected much by the gravity. The kinetic energy of the rocket after its fuel used up, $m_{0} v_{f}^{2} / 2$ should be greater than $g R m_{0} / 2$. Therefore, we get a result:\n\n$$\nv_{f}^{2}>g R\n\\tag{19}\n$$\n\nAny answer that gets rid of numerical factors like $u^{2} \\geq g R$ is acceptable. If a student remember the value of the first cosmic speed of the earth: $v_{o}=\\sqrt{g R}=7.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, and states that $v_{f}$, or a multiple of $u$ (like $2.302 u$ we got above), should be greater than $v_{o}$ is also great.\n\n- For launching our rocket to other planets, we need to escape from the gravitational field of the earth. That is, the final mechanical energy of the rocket should be greater than zero:\n\n$$\nv_{f}^{2}>2 g R\n\\tag{20}\n$$\n\nIt is also great if a student remember that the escape speed of the each is $v_{e}=\\sqrt{2 g R}=11.2$ and states that a multiple of $u$ should be larger than $v_{e}$.\n\n- The reason why rockets are multistage is that We see from previous parts that the ejection speed of the lightest fuel with $100 \\%$ energy conversion rate is only $u=5614 \\mathrm{~m} / \\mathrm{s}$, and the final speed $v_{f}$ of a very light rocket (mass ratio between fuel and rocket itself being 9 ) is just $\\approx 2.3 u=12.9 \\mathrm{~km} / \\mathrm{s}$, which is only at the same magnitude of the first cosmic speed and the escape speed.\n\nIn real world, rockets cannot be so ideal. Therefore, a single stage rocket can hardly be launched to orbit around the earth, not to mention escaping. Multistage rockets drop part of its mass to further increase the mass ratio between the remaining fuel and itself in order to make itself to the sky.\n\n",

Each of the spacecrafts is placed at the corners of an equilateral triangle as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3. The sides (or 'arms') are about 5.0 million kilometres long. The LISA constellation is in an earth-like orbit around the Sun trailing the Earth by $20^{\\circ}$. Each of them moves on a slightly inclined individual orbit around the Sun. Effectively, the three spacecrafts appear to roll about their common centre one revolution per year.\n\nThey are continuously transmitting and receiving laser signals between each other. Overall, they detect the gravitational waves by measuring tiny changes in the arm lengths using interferometric means. A collision of massive objects, such as blackholes, in nearby galaxies is an example of the sources of gravitational waves.\n\n<img_4574>\n\nFIGURE 2 Illustration of the LISA orbit.

    "question": "Initially, a switch $S$ is unshorted in the circuit shown in the figure on the right, a capacitor of capacitance $2 C$ carries the electric charge $q_{0}$, a capacitor of capacitance $C$ is uncharged, and there are no electric currents in both coils of inductance $L$ and $2 L$, respectively. The capacitor starts to discharge and at the moment when the current in the coils reaches its maximum value, the switch $S$ is instantly shorted. Find the maximum current $I_{\\max }$ through the switch $S$ thereafter.\n\n<image_1>",

    "solution": "Instead of determining the coefficients $A, B, D, F$ the vector diagram shown in the figure on the right can be used. The segment $A C$ represents the current sought and its projection on the current axis is zero at the time of the key shortening. The current $I_{1}$ in the coil of inductance $L$ grows at the same time moment because the capacitor $2 C$ continues to discharge, thus, this current is depicted in the figure by the segment $O A$. The current $I_{2}$ in the coil of inductance $2 L$ decreases at the time of the key shortening since it continues to charge the capacitor $2 C$, that is why this current is depicted in the figure by the segment $O C$.\n\nIt is known for above that $O B=I_{0}, O A=\\sqrt{5} I_{0}, O C=\\sqrt{2} I_{0}$. Hence, it is found from the Pythagorean theorem that\n\n$$\nA B=\\sqrt{O A^{2}-O B^{2}}=2 I_{0}\n\\tag{C2.1}\n$$\n$$\nB C=\\sqrt{O C^{2}-O B^{2}}=I_{0}\n\\tag{C2.2}\n$$\n\n<img_4426>\n\nThus, the current sought is found as\n\n$$\nI_{\\max }=A C=A B+B C=3 I_{0}=\\omega q_{0}=\\frac{q_{0}}{\\sqrt{2 L C}}\n\\tag{C2.3}\n$$\n\nMethod 3. Heuristic approach\n\nIt is clear that the current through the key performs harmonic oscillations with the frequency\n\n$$\n\\omega=\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 L C}}\n\\tag{C3.1}\n$$\n\nand it is equal to zero at the time of the key shortening, i.e.\n\n$$\nI(t)=I_{\\max } \\sin \\omega t\n\\tag{C3.2}\n$$\n\nSince the current is equal to zero at the time of the key shortening, then the current amplitude is equal to the current derivative at this time moment divided by the oscillation frequency. Let us find that current derivative. Let the capacitor of capacitance $2 C$ have the charge $q_{1}$. Then the charge on the capacitor of capacitance $C$ is found from the charge conservation law as\n\n$$\nq_{2}=q_{0}-q_{1} .\n\\tag{C3.3}\n$$\n\nAfter shortening the key the rate of current change in the coil of inductance $L$ is obtained as\n\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{1}=\\frac{q_{1}}{2 L C}\n\\tag{C3.4}\n$$\n\nwhereas in the coil of inductance $2 L$ it is equal to\n\n$$\n\\dot{I}_{2}=-\\frac{q_{0}-q_{1}}{2 L C}\n\\tag{C3.5}\n$$\n\nSince the voltage polarity on the capacitors are opposite, then the current derivative with respect to time finally takes the form\n\n$$\n\\dot{I}=\\dot{I}_{1}-\\dot{I}_{2}=\\frac{q_{0}}{2 L C}=\\omega^{2} q_{0}\n\\tag{C3.6}\n$$\n\nNote that this derivative is independent of the time of the key shortening!\n\nHence, the maximum current is found as\n\n$$\nI_{\\max }=\\frac{\\dot{I}}{\\omega}=\\omega q_{0}=\\frac{q_{0}}{\\sqrt{2 L C}}\n\\tag{C3.7}\n$$\n\nand it is independent of the time of the key shortening!",

The first process isasecondary electron emission, and the second one isa formation of electron avalanche. The secondary electron emission occurs when ions hit on the negative electrode, called a cathode, and the electrons are knocked out of it to move towards the positive electrode, called an anode. The ratio of the number of the knocked electrons $\\dot{N}_{e}$ per unit timeto the number of ions $\\dot{N}_{i}$ hitting the cathode per unit time is called the coefficient of the secondary electron emission, $\\gamma=\\dot{N}_{e} / \\dot{N}_{i}$. The formation of the electron\n\n<img_4503>\navalanche isexplained as follows. The electric field accelerates free electrons which acquire enough kinetic energy to ionize the atoms in the gas by hitting them. As a result the number of free electrons moving towards the anodesignificantly increases.
