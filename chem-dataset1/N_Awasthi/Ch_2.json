Thomson as a result of the studies of the passage of electricity through gases at extremely low pressures known as discharge tube experiments. When a high voltage of the order of 10,000 volts or more was impressed across the electrodes, some sort of invisible rays moved from the negative electrode to the positive electrodes these rays are called as cathode rays. Properties of Cathode rays : Cathode rays travels in straight path and produce mechanical effect. Cathode rays consist of material part and charged particles. Cathode rays produce X-rays and light is emitted when they strike on ZnS screen. Cathode rays penetrate through thin sheets of aluminium and other metals. They affect the photographic plate and passes heating effect when they strike on metal foil. The ratio of charge to mass i.e. charge/mass is same for all the cathode rays irrespective of the gas used in the tube. The existence of positively charged particles in an atom was shown by E. Goldstein. He repeated the same discharge tube experiments by using a perforated cathode.
