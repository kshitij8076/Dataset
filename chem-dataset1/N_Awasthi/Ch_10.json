Statement-2 is also false as a general rule; the strength of bonds varies greatly. A strong covalent bond (like in diamond) is stronger than a typical ionic bond, but many covalent bonds are weaker. However, the premise that covalent bonds are generally stronger is not universally true. The answer key implies S1 is true and S2 is false. Let's re-evaluate S1. Ionic crystals have 'high' melting points, but not necessarily the 'highest'. This makes S1 debatable but arguably false. S2 is definitively false as a blanket statement. Let's assume the key (C) is correct, meaning S1 is TRUE and S2 is FALSE. This would imply the question considers 'high' and 'highest' to be synonymous in this context."

K_h = K_w/K_a = 10⁻¹³/10⁻⁵ = 10⁻⁸. We have K_h ≈ [OH⁻]² / C. 10⁻⁸ = (10⁻⁵)² / C => C = 10⁻¹⁰ / 10⁻⁸ = 0.01 M. Now, C = (mass/M)/V => 0.01 = (2.592/M)/2 => M = 2.592 / 0.02 = 129.6 g/mol.\nStep 2: Find density (ρ). In rock salt structure, Z=4. The distance between cation and anion is a/2 = 300 pm, so edge length a = 600 pm = 6 × 10⁻⁸ cm. ρ = (Z × M) / (a³ × N_A) = (4 × 129.6) / ( (6×10⁻⁸)³ × 6×10²³ ) = 518.4 / (216×10⁻²⁴ × 6×10²³) = 518.4 / 129.6 = 4.0 g/cm³."
